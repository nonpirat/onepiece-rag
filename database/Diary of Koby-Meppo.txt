Diary of Koby-Meppo



Long Summary


Koby and Helmeppo join the Marines, but find themselves doing a large amount of janitor work. Koby takes all the chores they have to do in stride, but Helmeppo does not, angrily stabbing a doll resembling Luffy. However, Koby continues to do his best in order to become a full member of the Marines, even studying hard during night hours.

The two are later tasked with chore duty on a ship transferring the prisoner Morgan, much to their shock. As they clean the ship's weapons, Helmeppo is worried about his father possibly getting the death penalty. However, Helmeppo later notices something shocking: the ship of the famed Vice Admiral Garp is coming. Garp prepares to take Morgan over to his ship, and Koby has to restrain Helmeppo. However, Morgan catches Garp off-guard and slashes him before taking Helmeppo hostage in the process. Morgan then escapes with Helmeppo on a small boat.

Quickly, the Marines prepare to fire on the small vessel to ensure Morgan's demise. However, Koby, not willing to let them kill his friend, scares them away with a gun. Bogard cuts Koby's guns into pieces, but Garp steps in before the two can continue fighting, claiming that he had been sleeping when Morgan slashed him. Meanwhile, on Morgan's escape vessel, Helmeppo finally makes a decision and abandons his father.

Helmeppo swims back to the Marine ship, where he, Koby, and the other Marines apologize to Garp for the ruckus and call themselves worthless. It seems like forever before Garp speaks, but after five seconds Garp decides to take the two with him. However, Koby and Helmeppo still have to do janitor duty at their new headquarters, but they still get to train in the night, only this time they do physical exercises. Back at their old headquarters, the girl they shared lunch with demands to know where they are, as Garp oversees his beaten and bruised trainees training.
