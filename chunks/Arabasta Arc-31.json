{"content": "- This is the first arc to demonstrate fusing Zoan-type Devil Fruits with weapons; i.e., Lassoo with the Inu Inu no Mi, Model: Dachshund (this would not be seen again until the Enies Lobby Arc). It also foreshadows Dr. Vegapunk's abilities with Devil Fruits.\n- Robin's character is one of the most important issues of this arc concerning the larger story. She introduces the Poneglyphs and the True History, and is the second person to speak about the Will of D. Also, her sad past is foreshadowed.\n- Another important consequence of this arc is the arrest of Baroque Works and the imprisonment of its main members in Impel Down. During that particular arc they will be seen again, but instead, they are on Luffy's side in his attempt to rescue Portgas D. Ace. Prior to the Summit War Saga, the other three officer agents (along with Lassoo) who were arrested in this story arc were freed before the others were sent to Impel Down.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Arabasta Arc.txt", "title": "Arabasta Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 155 to 217"}}
