{"content": "On the island of Boin Archipelago, Usopp, now fat from eating the island's natural food, is trying to fight his way past a giant horned beetle despite the pleas of his companion, Heracles. He gets knocked down and Heracles mentions that the further out from the island you go, the tougher the creatures are, making it impossible to escape. Usopp, on the other hand, does not listen and takes off again just as the Sea Kings, distracted by the smell of the island, begin to arrive. Heracles notices the island beginning to move and warns Usopp to cling to something, as we find out the island is actually one large carnivorous plant called the Stomach Baron. Usopp is nearly eaten, but Heracles saves him and asks what is wrong, having noticed that Usopp changed after he read a newspaper dropped by a newspaper bird. Usopp answers that he found out about Ace's death and is trying desperately to get off the island to help Luffy through his pain; otherwise, he could not call himself a member of Luffy's crew.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
