{"content": "Blackbeard is seen laughing some more, claiming that he will destroy everything. Elsewhere, while Buggy is flying in the air, he notices a gleam of light as Kizaru shoots another laser beam in his direction. Fearing for his life, Buggy hurls Jinbe and Luffy at the deck of Law's submarine. Bepo commands Jean Bart to grab them. Kizaru commends Law for escaping from him during the incident at Sabaody Archipelago and is about to attack him until a shout is heard. The shouting is revealed to be coming from Koby, who yells for everyone to stop fighting since the Marines have families waiting for them and lives are being wasted. He yells at how the Marines already accomplished their goal, how they are chasing pirates who do not wish to fight, desiring war, and abandoning injured Marines while they could be treated, finishing his speech with how any Marine that falls at this point is foolish. Akainu simply tells Koby that seconds have been wasted, and that the Marines do not need someone like this, and he gets ready", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
