Orochi decided to use the immense amount of leverage he had to demand that they bring him Vegapunk to continue their trade. When Joseph protested, Orochi shot him, saying he was untouchable due to Kaidou backing him. Orochi then went to partake in his banquet, where he celebrated with Komurasaki, Robin, and many others. As the banquet progressed, Robin snuck off to try to gather information. However, she was caught by Orochi's ninja squad, the Orochi Oniwabanshu. The ninja moved to restrain her, only to find out it was a body double. As Robin ran back to the banquet hall, their leader Fukurokuju ordered them to sneak around and find her. Robin reported her situation to Nami, Shinobu, and Brook, who had also infiltrated the castle.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
