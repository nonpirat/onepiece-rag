{"content": "- Big Mom has an enmity with the Giant race due to unwittingly killing one of their heroes as a child, as well as unwittingly causing the mysterious disappearance of Carmel and the Sheep's House children. She attempted to amend relations with them through a political marriage between her daughter Lola and Prince Loki of Elbaf, but Lola ran away. Big Mom attempted to substitute Lola's identical twin sister Chiffon in her place, but the giants saw through the ruse, which only made tensions between them worse. Big Mom has since abandoned her efforts to befriend the giants, and has nursed a grudge against Lola and Chiffon ever since.\n\t\t- No giants reside in Totto Land as a result of this enmity. Big Mom commissioned Caesar Clown\u00a0to\u00a0research\u00a0artificial gigantism, so that she might convert members of her family into giants. Caesar blew off the assignment and embezzled the funds, so Big Mom sent her underlings to track him down from Dressrosa to Zou.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Whole Cake Island Arc.txt", "title": "Whole Cake Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 825 to 902"}}
