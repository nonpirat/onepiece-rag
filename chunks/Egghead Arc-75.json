{"content": "Near Elbaf, the Kid Pirates were confronted by Shanks' allies, but Shanks ordered them aside. After checking up on Kid's bounty and statistics, Shanks foresaw Kid using his Damned Punk to devastate the fleet, so he immediately rushed to the Victoria Punk and sliced the railgun in half before Kid had a chance to fire it. Shanks' strike and the resulting explosion knocked out both Kid and Killer, who had tried to defend his captain. The Kid Pirates who had withstood Shanks' Haoshoku Haki burst quickly surrendered and offered the Road Poneglyph rubbings in exchange for sparing their lives. Shanks took the rubbings and left the Victoria Punk before Dorry and Brogy's Hakoku hit the ship, splitting it in half and sinking the Kid Pirates.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
