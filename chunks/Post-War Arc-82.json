Jinbe has decided to head back to Fish-Man Island, thanking Luffy for freeing him and mentioning that he would wait for him to visit Fish-Man Island in two years. With that, he heads off, and Luffy and the Kuja bid him farewell. Afterward, Luffy, the Kuja Pirates, and Rayleigh head to an abandoned island not far from Amazon Lily called Rusukaina. Rayleigh brought Luffy there to train him. He forbids Hancock and her pirates from coming to see Luffy during his training period, so he can make him stronger without distraction. Once the Kuja Pirates are gone, Rayleigh begins Luffy's training by mentioning that the island was once inhabited, but the chaotic climate changes and the ferocious nature of the wildlife eventually killed all the natives. As a wild elephant comes charging at them, Rayleigh explains the basic concepts of Haki, using the elephant to demonstrate them.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
