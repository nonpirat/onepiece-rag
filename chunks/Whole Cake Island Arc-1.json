{"content": "Meanwhile, the Sanji Retrieval Team was starving when Luffy finally caught a fish. He immediately started eating it, but its skin turned out to be extremely poisonous and put him on the brink of death. The Thousand Sunny then entered Totto Land and was soon confronted by a ship belonging to Germa 66. They were greeted by Sanji's brother, Vinsmoke Yonji, and Yonji refused to help Luffy. However, his sister Vinsmoke Reiju then attacked him and came to the Sunny, where she used her \"Poison Pink\" abilities to suck the poison out of Luffy's body. Reiju revealed that the upcoming marriage had been arranged by her father, who initially had trouble finding Sanji until his bounty poster had been updated. This caused Luffy to become antagonistic toward her and Yonji, but the two siblings decided to part ways peacefully with the Straw Hats to avoid making a scene before the wedding.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Whole Cake Island Arc.txt", "title": "Whole Cake Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 825 to 902"}}
