{"content": "- About the Marines:\n\t\t- Akainu is the new Fleet Admiral of the Marines, having fought with Aokiji for the position over the course of ten days; eventually, Akainu won, and Aokiji left the Marines. Their fight would cause the climate of the island Punk Hazard to be split between an icy, snowy tundra and a magma-filled landscape.\n\t\t- With this loss of military power, the World Government would grant unprecedented power to the Marines to fill in the gap and move Marineford to the New World.\n\t- About the Blackbeard Pirates:\n\t\t- Blackbeard became an Emperor and has conquered the majority of the islands which were once under Whitebeard's control.\n\t\t- The Blackbeard Pirates have started hunting strong Devil Fruit users and taking their powers for themselves.\n- Big Mom made her first appearance in the series. Also, some members of her crew (Tamago, Pekoms, Bobbin and Pudding) would be introduced.\n- Luffy declared war against Big Mom, foreshadowing the Straw Hats fighting the Big Mom Pirates someday.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
