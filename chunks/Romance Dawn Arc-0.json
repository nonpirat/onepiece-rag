Before he was executed, he announced to the crowd that he had left all his treasure at a certain place that could only be discovered by scowering the entire world, causing the world to enter the Great Age of Pirates.\n\nEleven years later, the Red Hair Pirates came to a small port village named Foosha Village. After a year of them being there, a young boy named Monkey D. Luffy came to their ship to prove he was tough enough to join them by stabbing his face under his left eye. The pirates and Luffy then went to the bar, where the pirates toasted to Luffy's craziness as they ate and drank. Luffy tried to convince the captain, \"Red-Haired\" Shanks, to let him join the crew, but Shanks gently refused due to Luffy being too young and unable to swim.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Romance Dawn Arc.txt", "title": "Romance Dawn Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1 to 7"}}
