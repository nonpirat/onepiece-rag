{"content": "Hody keeps attacking and Neptune dives in the way, shielding the guards from further harm. Hody mocks Neptune for this selflessness, citing that Neptune is unfit to be king. Zoro sends a sword slash at Hody but the latter uses one of his comrades as a shield to block the attack. Zoro tells the others to untie the ropes of the guards, citing that he could not keep the hostages safe as promised so the negotiations are off, showing integrity which the minister comments on with surprise and respect. Brook notices that Nami had run off while Hody orders his men to attack the guards and the Straw Hats. Usopp holds the invaders back by seeding out a Pop Green that blooms into a flower and sends out a horrible stink. With the water filling up fast and Brook's strength starting to fail, Zoro cuts Neptune's chains asks him to get the others out of the palace while he stays behind to battle Hody. Neptune complies as the palace completely fills with water. Zoro takes a deep breath and prepares to face off against Hody", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
