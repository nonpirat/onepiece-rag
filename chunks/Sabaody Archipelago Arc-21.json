{"content": "Meanwhile Luffy, Nami, Chopper, Robin and Brook tour the island with Hatchan, Camie and Pappag acting as guides. Hatchan warning them not to draw attention to themselves as even though pirates walk freely on the island so do Marines and bounty hunters, plus if they are captured and sold as slaves the law will not help them. He also mentions to treat Camie and himself as regular people claiming it'll be easier for them (even bandaging the mark on his forehead, something Luffy notices).\n\nAfter which, the Fish-Man shows the Straw Hats the wonders of island and how they make use of the bubbles, from making bikes out of them and using them for transportation to holding their souvenirs in balloon-like bubbles to even creating hotels and shopping malls out of them the latter of which Nami and Robin depart from the group. However, Robin cannot help but notice Camie acting reserved since they have reached the island.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
