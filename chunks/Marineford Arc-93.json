{"content": "He goes on to remember how every person he met hated Gol D. Roger and detested the idea of his living son. If it were not for Luffy and \"Sabo,\" he would never have wanted to live. Ace then requests that if Luffy ever meets Dadan again, to tell \"that idiot\" goodbye for him. His only regret is that he will never get to see Luffy's dream come true, though it undoubtedly will. He comments that he has no regrets about the path he chose in life; all he really wanted was to know the answer to one question: whether or not he should have been born. Sensing his voice is getting too quiet, he then calls out to his comrades and, with his dying breath, thanks them for loving him.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
