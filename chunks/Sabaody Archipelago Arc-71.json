{"content": "Usopp tries to cover their escape with a Hissatsu Kemuri Boshi. But PX-1 blows up a bridge preventing Sanji's group from escaping before appearing right in front of them. Sentomaru goes for Luffy's group prompting Luffy to try to Gatling him. Sentomaru easily deflects the attack with his palms and sends him flying much to Luffy's shock. Sentomaru then hits him again and knocks Luffy into a tree, managing to actually hurt him as the Marine reveals he not a Devil Fruit user. An explosion nearby halts the fight, which Luffy notices it came from where Zoro's group ran.\n\nIndeed, his group ran into the worse possible scenario as Kizaru reveals himself before them. Zoro himself has taken the brunt of the Admiral's attack and compounded with his previous injuries, can no longer move while Brook and Usopp try desperately to keep Kizaru from killing Zoro.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
