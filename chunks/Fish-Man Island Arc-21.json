{"content": "As both parties realize what is going to happen, Vander Decken decides to pull out, ordering Wadatsumi and Ankoro to pull the ship away from the area. Surume takes the Sunny away from there. Both parties get a good distance away before the volcano explodes, sending out a shockwave. The Flying Dutchman, along with Wadatsumi and Ankoro, are blown away, though Surume is able to keep ahead as the magma begins to run down the volcano. Surume jumps in a darker area, falling into the trench as the volcano erupts again, causing an avalanche that destroys the trench above them and sends rocks falling toward the Sunny. A stray boulder falls on Surume, knocking him out, and both he and the Sunny plummet into the abyss.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
