{"content": "Meanwhile, Luffy once again tries to reach the execution platform but is stopped by Momonga and is forced to engage in a fight against him as well as another Vice Admiral with a Zoan Devil Fruit. Despite his best efforts, he is easily overwhelmed. He is then suddenly shot by a light beam by Kizaru. As Luffy lays defeated, the Admiral reminds him that he lacks the proper strength to save Ace and that guts alone will not get him through. He then kicks him back, right into Whitebeard, who catches him. Kizaru is insulted that the Emperor sent in Luffy first. Ivankov, using his Face Growth, peers over the wall and sees the condition Luffy is in, scolding him for acting so recklessly. Whitebeard tosses Luffy to one of his men to tend to his wounds, but Luffy shouts that he is alright and must save Ace. However, his wounds get to him, and he collapses as Jinbe asks a nearby doctor to look him over.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
