{"content": "Whitebeard says he knows the significance of his death and the consequences that it will bring, but he will not die until he has secured the future of his \"sons\" with his own hands. Jinbe and the other pirates then stand behind Whitebeard, claiming to defend his honor, while he calls them foolish. Sengoku berates Whitebeard and tells him to watch the future of his children as the guards prepare their weapons to execute Ace. The pirates call out to Ace, and while Whitebeard says that it is useless to try, he suddenly collapses due to his illness as he watches the guards about to execute Ace.\n\nLuffy shouts for the Marines to stop, unleashing a great burst of Haoshoku Haki that takes out the executioners and most of the Marines and pirates alike, to the shock of Sengoku and Aokiji (who wonder if this is really happening), and the amazement of Ivankov and Whitebeard.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
