{"content": "Suddenly, Hannyabal's men are sucked into some darkness, a figure telling him that despite all the talk of justice and evil, there really is no answer to be found. Said figure turns out to be Blackbeard who stomps Hannyabal into the ground, finally knocking him out. This pauses the fighting as he and his crew appear among the group with Luffy instantly remembering Blackbeard from Jaya. His name suddenly strikes a chord with Luffy who remembers that Ace told him he was looking for someone named Blackbeard and Elder Nyon mentions someone with the same name capturing Ace, as well as Teach's speech back on Jaya.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
