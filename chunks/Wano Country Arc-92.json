{"content": "While adventuring in the New World, Toki came down with a fever and collapsed. Crocus stated that she could not continue sailing in that state, and the crew decide to dock at Wano for Toki to stay there. Upon arrival, Oden's family were greeted by his retainers who asked him to stay as well and rule Wano, but Toki demanded he must not abandon his journey for her sake. Oden rejoined the Roger Pirates on his own. The crew then departed and headed to Zou to find the final Road Poneglyph.\n\nWith the transcripts of all four Road Poneglyphs, the Roger Pirates charted course to the final island, and conquered the Grand Line, with Roger becoming the Pirate King. Oden wrote of this experience, recounting that they had discovered the truths about the Void Century, the meaning of D., and the Ancient Weapons, and he learned that Wano had once been connected to the outside world. He continued to describe Roger finding Joy Boy's treasure, prompting Roger to name this island \"Laugh Tale.\"", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
