He had Law brought to him, and Law thought Corazon had told Doflamingo what had happened, but Doflamingo instead told Law that he was becoming an official member of the Donquixote Pirates.

A year passed, and the Donquixote Pirates moved around the North Blue as Law grew stronger through training and raids.
