{"content": "On Whole Cake Island, Big Mom sang and danced with anthropomorphic objects known as homies as she received reports of her crew members massacring people to acquire ingredients for the wedding cake. She then looked forward to dealing with Luffy, who she already knew had arrived. However, Big Mom was later stricken by a craving for croquembouche, and her mental illness made her mindlessly violent as she attacked Sweet City to find it. Her son, Charlotte Moscato, attempted to intervene, but she pulled out 40 years of his lifespan, causing the onlookers to pronounce him dead on the scene. As Big Mom neared her own castle, Jinbe then arrived and threw a pile of croquembouche tourists into her mouth, satiating her. Big Mom did not remember what she had done, and Jinbe asked to discuss something important with her. Big Mom took him to the Whole Cake Chateau, and Jinbe asked to leave her crew. Big Mom seemingly accepted, but stated that Jinbe would have to spin a roulette wheel to give something up in return.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Whole Cake Island Arc.txt", "title": "Whole Cake Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 825 to 902"}}
