{"content": "Meanwhile, seeing as that they could not leave the island, Yamato hid Momonosuke and Shinobu in a storeroom, where a broken dragon statue was stored. Yamato told them the story of Luffy's older brother, Portgas D. Ace, and recollected their fight and fast friendship, as well as Ace's stories of his little brother. When Momonosuke and Shinobu learned Yamato was Kaidou's son, they at first kept their distance but eventually trusted him again. Yamato talked about what was written in Oden's journal regarding his adventures and about the future, and he then gave the journal to Momonosuke. On the battlefield, Queen ordered his subordinates to restrain Marco, who was transporting Zoro, but they were easily shaken off. Queen and King confronted Marco themselves. Marco restrained them before throwing Zoro to the roof. On the fifth floor, Luffy encountered the Mink Tribe, and thanked them for defeating all the enemy pirates blocking the way to the roof, before proceeding.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
