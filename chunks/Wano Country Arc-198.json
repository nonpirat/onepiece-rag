Though Momonosuke pessimistically tried to avoid doing as Luffy said, recalling all the trauma Kaidou made him go through, the pink dragon gathered his courage and bit his blue counterpart. Just as Kaidou threatened to attack Momonosuke, Luffy punched the blue dragon away, before asking the young shogun whether, after biting an Emperor, there was anything in the world he was afraid of, which Momonosuke enthusiastically declared no. Luffy then told Momonosuke to stop Onigashima alongside Yamato, declaring he would definitely win. Kaidou then entered his hybrid form, before he and Luffy clashed with Haki, which ended up splitting the clouds. As Momonosuke and Yamato made their leave, Kaidou attempted to stop them. Yamato managed to defend the two from Kaidou's attack, long enough for Luffy to restrain the Emperor, allowing Momonosuke to fall off the edge of the Skull Dome.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
