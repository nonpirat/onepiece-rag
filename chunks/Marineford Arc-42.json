{"content": "Meanwhile, Ivankov tells Doflamingo that Kuma is standing before him and cannot be dead. Luffy recognizes Kuma and asks Ivankov if he and Kuma know each other, which Ivankov confirms while stating that something is wrong with Kuma.\n\nDoflamingo tells Ivankov that while the two seemed to know Kuma, the man standing before them was no longer Kuma, as Vegapunk had finished his modifications on the former Bartholomew Kuma. Doflamingo then explains to Ivankov the process Kuma volunteered to undergo, as his body was converted into a \"Pacifista\", with bits and pieces of him being modified at a time. Ivankov says that Doflamingo is lying as Kuma hated the World Government and would never work with them. While Doflamingo admits that he does not know what kind of deal Kuma and the World Government made. He goes on to say that not only a few days ago Kuma was still himself, but now he is a walking corpse with no human memory, following the World Government's every command: PX-0.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
