He then used his Devil Fruit to pierce through Doflamingo, saying that unlike Corazon, he would pull the trigger. Law went on the offensive, but Doflamingo quickly stopped his attacks, saying that Law was foolish to confront him alone and that everything he and Corazon aimed for would be for naught.
