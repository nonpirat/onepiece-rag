{"content": "At the church, Bonney continuously checked the mail for letters from her father, but none had arrived. Gyogyo thought that Kuma was busy or the News Coos were delivering to the wrong places, while Conney was hopeful that the letters would soon arrive. The truth was that Alpha had been intercepting and ripping every letter before they made it inside the church. One day, Alpha came inside to give Bonney medicine and noticed that she briefly looked bigger than normal after she and Gyogyo fought but could not figure out why.
