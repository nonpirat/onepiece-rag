{"content": "Then finally she returned, after much negotiation with the World Nobles and much appreciation of the island, holding a piece of paper that was said to be the \"Light of Hope\" for Fish-Man Island, a document granting the fish-men a place at the Levely once again. As all this happens, we get a little flashback of more of Vander Decken and his crew talking about the treasure of the Ryugu Kingdom. His crew mention the Tamatebako which supposedly could make anyone grow. Decken gets excited until his crew mention that they cannot get into the palace unless he was married to Shirahoshi. Decken then starts scheming to marry Shirahoshi to get the treasure of the Ryugu family which is what his ancestors have been after for years. Meanwhile, Otohime shows the paper to her subjects, telling them that she managed to convince a World Noble to give the fish-men their backing for the relations of fish-men and humans. The only thing she needs now are the signatures to make it happen and ask her subjects for their support.
