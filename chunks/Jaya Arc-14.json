{"content": "- This arc would also start the recurring theme of the Going Merry falling apart after the major damage it took in escaping from the Marines in Arabasta and that it continued to fall apart from the Straw Hats' latest battles, as well as Usopp serving as the acting shipwright to keep it functional (who previously repaired the minor damages to the Going Merry during the Reverse Mountain and Drum Island Arcs).\n- This arc reveals that Sanji was born in the North Blue. Sanji's past would be further explored in the future.\n- While Luffy may have met Blackbeard here without knowing who he was, he would not learn his true identity until the Impel Down Arc.\n- Shanks tries to contact Whitebeard and sends the newest member, Rockstar, to deliver a letter, but Whitebeard demands to see Shanks in person, forcing the Red Hair Pirates to travel and leading to an important meeting in the Post-Enies Lobby Arc.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Jaya Arc.txt", "title": "Jaya Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 218 to 236"}}
