{"content": "The news of Luffy hitting a World Noble quickly spreads throughout the island, causing more widespread panic. Most of the Supernovas quickly decide to leave the island to avoid the inevitable dispatch of an Admiral, though a few who are curious decide to stay behind and see which Admiral will come. At Mary Geoise, the news has reached Sengoku, who becomes greatly irritated upon hearing that it was Luffy who committed the act. A Marine informs him that the pirates have taken the World Nobles \"hostage\" at the Human Auctioning House (or \"Public Employment Security Office\" as he calls it) but have not yet given any demands. An Admiral, Kizaru, speaks up suddenly, telling Sengoku that he will handle it.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
