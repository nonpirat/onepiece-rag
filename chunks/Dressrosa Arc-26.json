In Dressrosa, Thunder Soldier told Franky that humans and toys were segregated at night, and they saw a toy who claimed to be the boyfriend of a woman named Esta. The toy was diagnosed with \"human sickness\" and thrown into the scrap heap. Franky and the Soldier then met a toy dog named Onepoco, who revealed that he was once a human named Milo and the woman and boy he was playing with were his wife and son. The son said he had no father, and Thunder Soldier revealed to Franky that all the toys were once humans who were transformed by a Devil Fruit user who came with him ten years ago, causing them to be forgotten by the people of Dressrosa. The Soldier said he would say more once he and Franky reached the Flower Hill.
