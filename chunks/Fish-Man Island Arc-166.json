{"content": "Luffy tells Surume to protect the princess while the pirates look on in disbelief that the kraken sided with Luffy. Chopper notices that most of the pirates have avoided them which Usopp decides to take advantage of to attack their captain. However, they suddenly wind up falling into a pitfall made by Daruma who used his teeth to burrow underground to stop their machines. Daruma sets out to do the same to Franky, but the cyborg ends up accidentally driving his motorcycle into the same one the tank fell into. Angered at this, Franky tosses Usopp, Nami, Chopper and Pappag out of the hole.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
