{"content": "As Marineford begins to crumble from the earthquake, the pirates persist in getting Whitebeard to come with them, but he stubbornly yells at them to leave. The Marines open fire on Whitebeard, but he continues to attack, while his crew reluctantly fulfills his wishes and proceeds to pull out. Sengoku goes to check on Garp, who rises to his feet with nothing but a bloodied forehead. Garp realizes that Whitebeard intends to end the current age of piracy before he dies. Buggy, having recovered from being frozen by Aokiji, is told by one of his followers that the Den Den Mushi has recovered. Buggy orders him to film him as he takes Whitebeard's life. The broadcast to Sabaody is renewed (though the citizens are disappointed to see only Buggy onscreen once again).", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
