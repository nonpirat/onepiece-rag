{"content": "As they finish the story, Luffy notices the different colors and sizes of the residents of Fish-Man Island. He sees that one of the fish-men has a mermaid child. Pappag states that when a fish-man and mermaid marry, their offspring can be either one of the two, hence the variety of their species. As the group heads for a highway, they spot a candy factory with a pirate flag on it. Pappag explains that it belongs to Charlotte Linlin, a.k.a. \"Big Mom\" of the Four Emperors, who has taken over as the protector of the island after Whitebeard's death. In return, the island must produce candy for her every month.\n\nLuffy wonders if he will meet her someday and comments that she is a nice person to take over Whitebeard's role. Pappag, however, seems unconvinced as Whitebeard never asked for collateral and assumes that Big Mom is seeing her protection from a business perspective. Soon, the group reaches Gyoverly Hills and sees Pappag's mansion upon arrival.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
