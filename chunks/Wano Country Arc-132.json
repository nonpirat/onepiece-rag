While doing this, she let Kikunojo's cut arm fall in the Live Floor below. Zoro, distracted by his ongoing fight with Apoo and enraged that he was not assisting the Samurai, decided to unleash a finishing move on Apoo in order to obtain the antibody vial and bring Queen's stalling game to an end.

Yamato, who was trying to find a way out to the ocean, noticed that the island was not at sea anymore, having been brought airborne by Kaidou's power.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
