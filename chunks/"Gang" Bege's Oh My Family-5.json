{"content": "Determined to be with his daughters, Pound swims after the Fire Tank Pirates' ship amidst the cannon fire, which surprises the sisters but elates Pez. As Pound gets close to the ship, he shows the crew proof of his claims; a picture of the moment when Linlin literally kicks him out of the family, with their newborn daughters in the background. Upon seeing the photo, as well as his stubbornness, the sisters finally believe him after they recall their mother telling them that their father was a clingy person who never gives up no matter how many times he's kicked out, and they help their father onto the ship with ropes with the help of Bege and Gotti. Once onboard, a tearful Pound happily embraces both of his daughters after 26 long years.", "metadata": {"source": "database/\"Gang\" Bege's Oh My Family.txt", "title": "\"Gang\" Bege's Oh My Family", "Chapters": "Chapters 948 to 994"}}
