Akainu reaches Jinbe and tells him to hand over Dragon's son. Jinbe tries to get to the ocean, claiming he will have the advantage in the water. However, he realizes everything is ice, thanks to Aokiji. Jinbe looks back, seeing Akainu already on his heels. Akainu jumps after him, punching Jinbe to the ice. The blow goes through Jinbe and strikes Luffy, leaving an x-shaped scar on his chest.\n\nJinbe stands up, looking at the unconscious Luffy and apologizes for causing more damage to him.
