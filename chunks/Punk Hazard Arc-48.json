{"content": "Back in the Straw Hats' hiding spot, Luffy arrives and sees Brownbeard's injured body. Chopper informs him that two mysterious figures came and attacked them, and also took Nami in Franky's Body. Luffy decides to set out, but before he does, Franky in Chopper's body decides to go as well and asks Chopper for one of the \"beans\" he uses to transform. Chopper gives him one of the Rumble Balls and tells him only to use it in emergency, but before he finishes his sentence, Franky transforms into Monster Point and goes into a rampage. Luffy heads out and is oblivious to the fact that Franky has gone berserk, as he instructs him to follow him.\n\nMeanwhile in Caesar's Lab, Caesar remarks on his surprise to find out that Franky had Vegapunk's weapons and says he cannot wait to cut him open. Caesar then tells his underlings not to provoke the Marines, and to just let them take refuge, because he has a plan.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
