{"content": "Franky explains that after he arrived back on Sabaody, he found Kuma heavily damaged and rusted. Kuma then declared his mission complete and headed off, which confuses Franky. Franky then found out from Rayleigh that, during their battle against Kizaru, Kuma had whispered to Rayleigh that he was a Revolutionary and wished to help the Straw Hats escape. After blasting the Straw Hats away, he later met with Rayleigh and told him he did not have much time left. Since he was treated like a guinea pig by the Marines, his body was becoming more machine than human. He then made a deal with Dr. Vegapunk that before his personality was completely gone, he would have a program embedded in him to return to the Straw Hats' ship and guard it until one of the Straw Hats returned.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
