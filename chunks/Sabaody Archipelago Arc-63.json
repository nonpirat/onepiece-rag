{"content": "Urouge suddenly toppled by them, bruised badly and citing his bad luck at running into a Warlord of the Sea and, upon seeing Kizaru, an Admiral as well. Hawkins informs him that the shadow of death is not upon him yet though he takes this news as a joke. X Drake suddenly appears and kicks Kuma aside. Kizaru instantly recognizes the pirate while X Drake comments he wasn't trying to run into an Admiral. Urouge then recovers and increases in size becoming huge. Now ready for a counterattack while Apoo continues to look on from a roof enjoying what's occurring before him.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
