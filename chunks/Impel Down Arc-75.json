{"content": "This new development is quickly broadcasted to the Monitor Room, which causes Hannyabal to freak out more than he already was. With Luffy's group on Level 4, a riot led by Buggy and Mr. 3 on the Level 2 and Blackbeard at the entrance, his panic seems justified especially since he is in charge of the prison at the moment. Suddenly, Magellan calls over the Den Den Mushi, having come back inside Impel Down and poisoned most of the prisoners on Level 2, as well as sealing all the exits, much to Buggy and Mr. 3's dismay. Magellan however decides to send all his forces to Level 4 as a last-ditch effort since he cannot call reinforcements and hopes the staff will hold out until he gets there. This greatly improves Hannyabal's morale, who cheers for the warden much to the confusion of his troops. Magellan also decides to take the dangerous risk of freeing Shiryu.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
