{"content": "In Grove 47, Chopper is following who he thinks is Zoro and Sanji, but in reality, is more of the Fake Straw Hats; this group is comprised of the former two as well as a Robin and Chopper, who are a short woman and fox, respectively. Fake Zoro and Fake Sanji recognize Chopper as a real Straw Hat. Thinking he is abandoned by his crew and believing he is their \"pet,\" they plan to lure him over to their side to make the Fake Straw Hats look more credible. Fake Robin tries to entice Chopper with a cucumber, but the men who were following Robin rush in and grab the fake one, along with the Fake Chopper, in a sack before fleeing.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Return to Sabaody Arc.txt", "title": "Return to Sabaody Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 598 to 602"}}
