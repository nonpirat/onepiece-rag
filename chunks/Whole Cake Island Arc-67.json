{"content": "Perospero took Big Mom to Cacao Island to eat the wedding cake, but to his horror, she decided to go to Nuts Island instead and destroyed everything in her path as she looked for cake. Luffy and Br\u00fbl\u00e9e arrived on Nuts Island through the mirror, and ended up right in front of the rampaging Big Mom. Perospero pointed her to Luffy, and Luffy was forced to run away while still being unable to use Haki. Eventually, Luffy took Br\u00fbl\u00e9e inside a mirror, and the two of them visited several islands before eventually ending up in an empty house. As he waited to regain his Haki, Luffy remembered Silvers Rayleigh teaching him that Haki could be strengthened by battling opponents with strong Haki. This made him decide to use the fight against Katakuri to improve his own Haki.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Whole Cake Island Arc.txt", "title": "Whole Cake Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 825 to 902"}}
