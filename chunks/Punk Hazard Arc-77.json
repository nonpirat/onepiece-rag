{"content": "Luffy sees Zoro's group on screen which gets Caesar's attention, claiming that the gas will get them sooner or later. He then has the cage the prisoners are in taken outside by a crane, citing that he wishes to prove that his weapon is tougher than any high bounty pirate, Marine vice admiral or Warlord of the Sea. Chopper, seeing this from his hiding spot, starts panicking and wonders what to do. However, a piece of paper suddenly falls on him which turns out to be a note telling him \"Don't Do Anything\" to his confusion on who threw it. The captives' prison box is hung outside which the Marines notice as well as their captain's within it, pleading for the two to help them. Despite the incoming death, Luffy, Robin and Franky are rather nonchalant about the situation. Law then tells Luffy that it is time to make their move for a counterattack.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
