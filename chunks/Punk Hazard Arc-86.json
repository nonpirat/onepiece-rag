{"content": "The Marines continue their assault, but just as Zoro is about to strike them. Tashigi jumps in and block his attack. Begrudgingly allowing Zoro to pass her as she tells her men they have other concerns at the moment with the building's gate closing. The Marines agree and everyone rushes for the gate. Just as they do, a cannon from outside the building fires and hits the wall, letting the gas in. Everyone makes a mad dash and jumps through the gate. Brownbeard, the Straw Hat Pirates and some of the G-5 soldiers make it through as well as Tashigi. However, it is revealed she was thrown by a few of her subordinates who were lingering behind. Tashigi tries to go back to rescue them but is told it is too late. One of the fellow Marines compliments those that could not make it on saving their Captain. As the gate closes, they see that the men caught in the gas giving thumbs up poses as they were frozen much to Tashigi's dismay and sorrow for their sacrifice while the Straw Hats stare disgusted over what occurred.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
