{"content": "The Sunny flies over the island with Shirahoshi following. Zoro comments that they left in a hurry because they did not want to be viewed as heroes (though contradicts himself about wanting to drink booze). Luffy meanwhile, is complaining to Jinbe about not coming with them. Jinbe admits he is flattered that Luffy asked him but says he has things he needs to do. However, when his task is done, he promises the crew he will join them then. Luffy agrees with this as does the rest of the crew. Neptune soon catches up with them and reminds them he still owes the Straw Hats a banquet. This is enough to get Luffy to stay, and he has Hatchan and Camie picked up as well.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
