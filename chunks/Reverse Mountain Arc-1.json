{"content": "When they come down, they immediately run into a giant whale named Laboon, who is blocking their path. The Merry ends up running into the whale, which breaks its masthead. Luffy punches Laboon in the eye in retaliation for his seat being destroyed. Laboon then opens his mouth, swallowing the Going Merry, although Luffy manages to escape. Luffy tries hitting Laboon to get his friends out, but before the whale dives underwater, he spots and enters a trapdoor on the whale's back. Meanwhile, the other Straw Hats find themselves sailing towards an island inside Laboon. They soon encounter a giant squid, which is taken down by a man named Crocus. After an initially tense confrontation, Crocus points them toward an escape route.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Reverse Mountain Arc.txt", "title": "Reverse Mountain Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 101 to 105"}}
