{"content": "With the final strike, Luffy was defeated with his heart stopping and body deflating, his \"presence\" disappearing, which was noted not only by those present, but by Momonosuke and Joseph below. Kaidou then faced Guernica, who accepted his fate as Kaidou struck him down, before descending into the Skull Dome. There, he announced his victory whilst declaring Luffy dead and demanding to know where Momonosuke was, raising the morale of the Beasts Pirates, while the alliance's forces were full of disbelief, except for Law and Kid who also couldn't sense the Straw Hat captain. When Nami denied Kaidou's statement, he fired a Bolo Breath at her, which Marco managed to block. Declaring how he planned to enslave Wano's entire populace, which brought further despair to the alliance members, Kaidou again demanded for Momonosuke's head. The revitalized Beasts Pirates then aimed for Law and Kid, though their crew members came to their rescue, with both captains resolving to continue fighting despite their exhaustion.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
