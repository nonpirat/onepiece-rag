{"content": "When asked why, Franky reveals that he is going to \"transform\" and that it's a one-person vehicle. He merges the Black Rhino FR-U IV and the Brachio Tank V to combine and create the Iron Pirate: General Franky: A giant mecha bearing his likeness. Franky claims he used the genius Vegapunk's unfinished prototype designs and completed them through the application of Wapometal. The pirates are dumbstruck at this new creation, while Luffy, Usopp and Chopper are awed at the docking mecha. Nami and Robin remain indifferent. Regardless, Franky goes on the attack, first using the mech's sword to swing at the pirates' feet. When they jump, he comments he can hit them with cannons from his shoulder. Luffy thinks this to mean he will shoot them with the mecha's cannons but in reality, it's just Franky popping out of the cockpit and firing his own shoulder cannons before flattening the pirates with the mecha's weight.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
