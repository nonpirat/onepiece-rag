{"content": "Meanwhile, the Straw Hat Pirates separated into smaller groups, but after hearing from Jinbe that Luffy wanted to stop Kid, since they did not know the plan, and Zoro declaring he had to find Luffy to prevent them from being spotted, Usopp, Nami, Sanji and Chopper were worried both would be lost and spotted. Outside the castle, Luffy then asked some Beasts Pirates if they had seen Kid around. They explained that they had never heard his name. Luffy noticed the massive amount of food gathered there and witnessed some Beasts Pirates spill oshiruko and make jokes about giving it to the people of Okobore Town. Enraged after seeing the spilled food, Luffy remembered how happy Tama was when she was given oshiruko on her birthday.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
