{"content": "The brothers contact the guards to comes pick up Brook, Nami (Sanji), and Zoro claiming they have killed them before setting off after the others. Back in the main lab, Caesar has gotten word of this, Monet comments that defeating three of them felt too easy and asks Law if he knows them from two years ago. Caesar instantly accuses Law of calling them to the island, but Law states he only just found out when he ran into them at the front of the facility and would have warned Caesar otherwise. It goes into a flashback in which Law first arrived on the island and bargained to be Caesar's bodyguard in exchange for being allowed to roam free in the lab and not to tell anyone he was there, including Caesar's employer, Joker, Caesar accepted after Monet asked if he could heal the prisoners of the island. Back in the present Caesar apologizes for his outburst before Law asks about the kids. Caesar proves Chopper's theory by stating he gave them candy filled with gasses to get them to come back (to Law's disgust).", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
