When Moria learns about the news, he means he never heard about Teach alias Blackbeard. In the Wano Country Arc, Moria has an important encounter with Blackbeard, where he learns that the Blackbeard Pirates killed Moria's crew member Absalom and stole his devil fruit powers.\n- Both of the remaining two of the Four Emperors are briefly introduced in this arc after their concept was initially brought up in the previous arc.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Thriller Bark Arc.txt", "title": "Thriller Bark Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 442 to 489"}}
