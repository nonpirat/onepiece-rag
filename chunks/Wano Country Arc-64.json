{"content": "In the aftermath, Kid and Killer departed from the Prisoner Mine, with Kid being finished with pirate alliances and going to look for the rest of his crew. As Chopper treated Luffy's virus, Hyogoro, Raizo, Kiku, and Kawamatsu talked to the prisoners, who despite seeing them were still skeptical that they had come from 20 years in the past. Momonosuke was then called out while he was talking to Luffy, and when the prisoners saw him, they all bowed and expressed their relief, gaining confidence at seeing a member of the Kozuki Family still alive. Kawamatsu then headed off on his own to attend to some business, promising to reunite with everyone before the final battle. Within a day, Chopper had cured all the prisoners of the Mummy virus, and Hyogoro reunited with the four regional yakuza bosses: Omasa, Tsunagoro, Cho, and Yatappe, who nearly killed Luffy after he referred to Hyogoro casually. The yakuza bosses then declared they would go around the country and recruit the remaining rebels scattered around.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
