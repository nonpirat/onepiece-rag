{"content": "Upon reaching the destination, they find Spacey's comrades, Colonel Macro, General Galaxy and Sergeant Cosmo lying unconscious on the ground as well. Spacey begins to weep for his fallen friends while Enel watches on impassively. As the Lieutenant continues to mourn, an unknown figure approaches them from behind. The figure reveals himself as Seamars, captain of the Space Pirates who pierces Spacey in the back with his electric spear, severely injuring the robot. Enel only watches without a hint of empathy until Seamars jabs his spear into him next. Being a Logia and a Mantra user, Enel is completely unharmed as the spear passes through him. Enel then retaliates with a swift electrified kick to Seamars' face, knocking him out.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Enel's Great Space Operations.txt", "title": "Enel's Great Space Operations", "Chapters": "Chapters 428 to 474"}}
