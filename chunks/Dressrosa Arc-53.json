{"content": "Some of the Donquixote Pirates went up to confront Franky, and Thunder Soldier and Kabu sneaked into the lift they were on before the former attacked them with his sheer speed. However, Lao G was on the lift as well, and overpowered both the Soldier and Kabu. He beat up Thunder Soldier the rest of the ride, and Kabu then led some dwarves to take on Lao G while he and Rampo took the Soldier to the throne room. However, they were confronted by Gladius, who used the Pamu Pamu no Mi to rupture his forearms and injure the dwarves in the explosions. He then grabbed the Soldier and was about to rupture him before being attacked by Luffy, and Luffy and Viola took the Soldier away. Gladius attacked them with shrapnel, and Luffy burst out the window and pulled the three of them to the second floor. Gladius then encountered Kin'emon disguised as Doflamingo, and Kin'emon discovered that Kanjuro had escaped from the scrap heap in the Toy House. Luffy, Viola, and Thunder Soldier hid underneath the window of the throne", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
