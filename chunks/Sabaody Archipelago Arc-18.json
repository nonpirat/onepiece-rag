{"content": "The Sunny is back at sea and the Straw Hats are heading for Sabaody Archipelago. They have a takoyaki party with Hatchan cooking. Chopper, Brook, Sanji, Usopp, and especially Luffy are gorging themselves, enjoying it thoroughly. Hatchan tentatively asks Nami if she likes it, to which she replies that she has not forgiven him yet, but likes his takoyaki nonetheless.\n\nThe entire crew enjoy the takoyaki (with even Sanji being amazed at the flavor), until the \"eating trio\" of Usopp, Luffy and Chopper can continue no longer (just as well as Hatchan collapses exhausted from trying to keep up with their servings). It is then that Duval, whose face has become handsome, finds them. He expresses his gratitude for the change (and gets into fits about his own beauty), then gives the crew his Den Den Mushi number, saying if they need anything to just call him up before he and his gang (now renamed the Rosy Life Riders) depart.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
