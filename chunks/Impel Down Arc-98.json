{"content": "Back on Level 1, Magellan suddenly shifts to a new type of poison called Kinjite which he explains can destroy Impel Down itself. Luffy tries to hit him with his Gomu Gomu no Stamp, but the poison quickly spreads to the wax armor. Mr. 3, seeing this, cancels the wax armor before it infects Luffy. Magellan unleashes the ultimate power of his devil fruit, Venom Demon: Hell's Judgment, forming his poison globs into a giant skull-faced being. One of the escapees unfortunately gets hit by this and begs another to take him along. The poison on the man spreading to the one he grabbed and poisoning him too. Mr. 3 tells Luffy the poison now acts like an infection and that wax, or stone is now useless on it thus the group is forced to run away. Topside, the inmates, along with Bon Kurei, continue to wait at the entrance for Jinbe and the others noticing they hear cannon fire. Bon, however, worries that even if they grabbed a ship, the distance back would be too great, and Magellan could catch up to them by then.
