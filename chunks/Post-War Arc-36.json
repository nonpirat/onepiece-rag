{"content": "Ace then explains that they managed to beat Bluejam but their escape route got cut off. Dadan got burns on her body, but the duo managed to escape into the middle forest. They hid in the riverbank until everything died down, at which point Ace stole some medicine from the town to keep Dadan alive. Dadan is then patched up and set down to rest as the day goes on. Dadan asks why Ace did not run, to which he explains that he was afraid if he did, he'd lose something important to him, in this case, Luffy. Dadan soon realizes the similarities between him and Roger, as she remembers Garp explaining that Roger was the same way, not running because he was fearless but rather to keep the enemy from following after his crewmates. It was this trust that convinced Garp to take care of Ace in secret.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
