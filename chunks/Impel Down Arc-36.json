{"content": "Throughout this, Bon has hidden himself, convinced that Luffy cannot win, as Magellan is known to silence even the most ultimate of prisoners. With a heavy heart, he forces himself to run away, asking Luffy to forgive him. Meanwhile, Buggy and Mr. 3 argue over trying to escape due to the number of guards below and Magellan distracted. Mr. 3, however, manages to convince Buggy that they do not know anything about Hannyabal and might be able to take him on. With that they make their way to the Level 3 entrance. Back to Luffy, who finds himself fatigued as Magellan stands over him, asks him if he still wants to continue fighting. Luffy, however, states his determination on saving his brother and that if he was going to lose since Magellan is made of poison and he can't touch him, then he will just have to sacrifice his arms so he can win. Luffy instantly activates Gear 2 and proceeds to hit Magellan head on with a Gomu Gomu no Bazooka, hurting the Chief Warden but at the same time getting poison on his hands.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
