{"content": "As they do so, they talk with Rayleigh where he reveals he was a member of Gol D. Roger's crew and served as his first mate, much to their surprise (Hatchan apparently knew this too but did not tell them since they just needed a coating-engineer). Rayleigh also reveals how he met Hatchan (the Fish-Man had saved Rayleigh's life when he was a kid, and they had remained friends till Hatchan joined Arlong's crew then named the Sun Pirates). Sanji then questions how he could still be alive if Roger's crew were captured, to which Rayleigh reveals that Roger actually turned himself in. The government just made it seem that way to show their strength to the public. Rayleigh goes on to tell the reason why was because four years before he was executed, Roger came down with an incurable disease. His crew, however, came across Crocus at the entrance of the Grand Line and asked him to join Roger on his final journey to keep his disease in check.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
