{"content": "The prisoners begin to cheer on Buggy saying that he is truly a pirate hero while\u00a0the stronger escapees\u00a0on board talk about Buggy's past, each with their own opinion\u00a0on how a person with such a history can be so weak. Buggy though is reluctant since he knows the Marines will watch his every move from now on. Luffy mentions Rayleigh to him, causing Buggy to ask how he's doing and causing his followers to marvel at him even further.\n\nAs they begin to cheer, Buggy becomes more nervous but realizes he could take advantage of the situation. The escapees suddenly start suggesting of a mutiny and take over the ship, but Buggy calms them down and proclaims that the coming war is a once in a lifetime opportunity to take down Whitebeard. Buggy's words move his followers, and they swear their loyalty to him, averting the mutiny. With that the ship sails on for Marineford.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
