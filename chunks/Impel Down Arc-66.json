{"content": "Iva reveals to the astonished group that Inazuma ate the Choki Choki no Mi and thus can cut anything as if it were paper. Luffy complains that they cannot get through if the stairways are blocked, but Inazuma counters that despite the simplicity of Impel Down staff's plan it was enough to capture them and there is now no escape. Iva manages to disable the monitor Den Den Mushis, but notes it's too late to save Ace, as he is already topside being transferred to the Marines. Luffy's Vivre Card moving away from the prison also proves Iva's words. Despite this, Luffy states that if Ace is heading to Marine Headquarters, then so will he. Iva tries to talk him out of it, but Luffy counters saying that if he did not, he'd regret it for the rest of his life. Upon seeing Luffy's face, Iva compares it to facing Dragon. Suddenly a voice calls out to Luffy, offering to create a hole to get the group out of Level 6. However, Luffy knows the voice all too well, as it belongs to none other than Crocodile.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
