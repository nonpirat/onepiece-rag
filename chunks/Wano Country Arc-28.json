{"content": "In the Flower Capital, among news about the thief Ushimitsu Kozo and street murderer Kamazo, the Kozuki Family's allies received Kin'emon's secret message and understood it. As this happened, Nami and Shinobu infiltrated a high-ranking official's house to spy on a covert weapons trade deal, though were caught and forced to flee. While gliding away, Nami saw that Sanji had opened a soba stand on the street. Usopp, Robin, and Franky reunited with Sanji as they ate his soba, but trouble quickly arose when three thugs from the Kyoshiro Family came to try extorting money from him. When Sanji refused, they hit a little girl's bowl out of her hands, resulting in Sanji and Franky beating two of them to the ground. The third one ran off to report this to Kyoshiro, who told him to contact Queen to send assassins after Sanji.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
