{"content": "- Due to these events and being aware that the Empty Throne has an occupant, Sabo is thus targeted by Imu and the World Government, who annihilate the Lulusia Kingdom in the process and erase its existence from history using Vegapunk's creation Mother Flame. However, as Sabo was not on the island during its destruction, both he and several civilians who escaped with him have survived, and the civilians are recruited into the Revolutionary Army.\n\t\t\t\t\t- Sabo decides to disclose what he learned only to Dragon and Ivankov. He claims to have accomplished all of his three intended objectives: destroying the Hoof of the Soaring Dragon, freeing as many slaves as they could (including Kuma), and destroying the food stocks of the World Nobles. Because of Sabo's actions, twelve countries around the world decided to start rebellions and no longer pay the Heavenly Tribute, with eight of them finding success (save for the Lulusia Kingdom).", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
