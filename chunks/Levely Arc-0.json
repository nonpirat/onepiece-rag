{"content": "Levely Arc(Chapters 903 to 908, Volume 90)\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nLuffy, Sanji, Nami, Chopper, Brook, and Carrot were sailing to Wano on the Thousand Sunny after their escape from Totto Land when Luffy and Chopper discovered a Raid Suit that Niji had apparently given to Sanji. Despite the two's pleas, Sanji refused to try it, and Nami revealed the addition of Zeus to her Clima-Tact. Carrot then received the newspaper, which told the story of their exploits against Big Mom and also included two new bounties for Sanji and Luffy. Sanji was pleased that his bounty now surpassed Zoro's, but was dismayed that his bounty poster included his family name. Luffy became depressed because he thought his bounty decreased to 150,000,000, when in reality it had increased to 1,500,000,000.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Levely Arc.txt", "title": "Levely Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 903 to 908"}}
