{"content": "Just as one of the Sun Pirates about to pull the trigger, Otohime dashes in and manages to shield Mjosgard, taking the bullet for him though it only grazes her arm. She orders the pirates to throw down their guns as there are children watching. Jinbe and Aladine arrive on the scene with Shirahoshi and her brothers in tow. The Sun Pirates ask Otohime why she protected him despite knowing what he done to them. Otohime answers that she understands how they feel from the voices of their hearts (she possessed the Kenbunshoku Haki ability and had heightened empathy) but they should not pass on such hatred to their children. Jinbe realizes it is exactly what Fisher Tiger wished of his crew not to do for the sake of their island.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
