{"content": "Fighting Sanji on the tower's high landing, Jabra revealed his Tekkai Kenpo - a fighting style which allows him to move and fight while using Tekkai, making him all but immune to Sanji's kicks. Suddenly Jabra stopped the fight, tearfully offering Sanji his key and telling him that Robin is really his long-lost sister. Sanji ignored the deception and continued the fight.\n\nMeanwhile, Usopp, high above on the tower, came up with a plan.\n\nTo combat Jabra's impenetrable Tekkai, Sanji creates a new technique, Diable Jambe, where he heats up one foot with friction, resulting in powerful kicks that burn through his enemy's defense. He kicked Jabra all the way down to the ground floor, defeating him.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Enies Lobby Arc.txt", "title": "Enies Lobby Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 375 to 430"}}
