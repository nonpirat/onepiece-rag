{"content": "The whole room is speechless after such an attack (save for Law and Kid who are amused). Luffy apologizes to his crew for the attack though they understand given the circumstances and were even indifferent (Zoro even commenting he wanted to slice Charlos), instead commenting that this recent development had just made everything less complicated as they are, after all, pirates. Rosward is obviously not pleased, sending the place into yet another panic. The audience quickly clears out to avoid the World Noble's wrath and the guards set upon the Straw Hats, and a fight ensues. While Rosward demands for an Admiral and shoots at Luffy (to no avail), Zoro slices Camie's fishbowl in half. More Fish Riders arrive, dropping off Brook, Robin and Usopp who accidentally falls on Rosward, knocking him out and sparking more of the guards' anger as they take it as an attack. Luffy tells the group that they would leave once Camie has rid herself of her collar, but Law informs him that the Marines already have the place", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
