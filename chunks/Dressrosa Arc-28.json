{"content": "Franky and Thunder Soldier arrived at a cave underneath the Flower Field, where Zoro was with some of the dwarves, who revealed that Usopp had come to lead them. After the rest of the Tontattas had arrived with Robin and Usopp, Thunder Soldier went over the plan to depose Doflamingo, and Usopp looked for a chance to run away. Outside, Zoro and Wicca went to help the Sunny team when they ran into Sanji and Kin'emon near the Colosseum. Zoro told the two what was happening, and Violet reappeared, revealing that the Sunny was under attack and heading for Green Bit. Sanji went to rescue the Sunny, leaving Kin'emon with the Vivre Card Violet gave him, and Zoro and Kin'emon looked for a way to break into the Colosseum and rescue Luffy. Sanji rode toward Green Bit with Violet, who revealed the high Marine presence around the coast of the island. In the Dressrosa royal palace, Gladius of the Donquixote Pirates became enraged as he became more certain that Violet had betrayed them.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
