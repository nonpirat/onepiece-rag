{"content": "Nami, Chopper, and Carrot ran away from Randolph, and Carrot briefly clashed with the rabbit. They ended up by Pound again, and as they tried running back to the coast, they got back to Luffy still fighting with his reflection. However, they were accompanied by Luffy's reflection while the real Luffy was sent running the other way, and ended up going right back to Pound. The mirror version of Luffy then transformed into the eighth daughter of the Charlotte Family, Charlotte Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, and Br\u00fbl\u00e9e grabbed Nami as she prepared to scar her face. Nami managed to use her Clima-Tact to free herself, but when Carrot tried attacking Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, Br\u00fbl\u00e9e reflected her attacks before sending her into an alternate dimension known as the Mirro-World. Br\u00fbl\u00e9e then had the homies in the Seducing Woods attack Chopper and Nami, and Chopper activated Monster Point to allow Nami to run away. Eventually, Chopper was overwhelmed and sent to the Mirro-World as well.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Whole Cake Island Arc.txt", "title": "Whole Cake Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 825 to 902"}}
