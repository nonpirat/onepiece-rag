{"content": "Across the battlefield, Crocodile turns down Doflamingo's offer, saying that Doflamingo is not at his level and that instead Doflamingo could be his underling. Doflamingo laughs at how he thought Crocodile would be rational; the latter states that if he were, he would not have come to Marineford in the first place. He then performs Sables, attempting to blow Doflamingo away. The attack is not confined to Doflamingo, though, as Buggy is accidentally sucked into the vortex as well.\n\nAs Luffy and Mihawk continue their battle, the latter notes how Luffy is moving away from the execution platform. In a move of desperation, Luffy grabs onto Buggy and uses him as a shield against Mihawk's attack. Buggy screams angrily at Luffy as the latter continues to use him as a shield. Getting fed up, Buggy launches a Special Muggy Ball at Mihawk, who casually deflects it with his blade, causing it to explode in Buggy's face. Luffy, having finally gotten a break, dashes back towards the platform.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
