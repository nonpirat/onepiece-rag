{"content": "Nami, Sanji, Chopper and Shirahoshi yell at the two to stop. Luffy uses this distraction to try and hop on Megalo to go to the palace, but Jinbe hits him with the Fish-Man Karate move: Samegawara Seiken, knocking him away and managing to hurt him which Nami notices. Jinbe explains that Fish-Man Karate makes use of all surrounding water, including those in living organisms which allows him to attack anything even a rubberman such as Luffy. Luffy attacks back with a Jet Stamp. Jinbe manages to block it asking if that all Luffy's training has produced. Before the fight can go any further, Robin suddenly appears in between the two trying to stop the fight. But Luffy and Jinbe are on the verge of hitting her causing Sanji to step in to save her. However, it's reveals it wasn't actually Robin, but a clone made from her powers and Sanji winds up in a cross-counter of Luffy and Jinbe's attacks, all three getting hit.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
