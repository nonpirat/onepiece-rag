{"content": "Doldo prepared to retake the throne, and Rebecca was attended to as she got ready for her coronation, although she wanted to see Luffy again. Luffy made it to the window of her room, where he asked her if she was fine with what Kyros had done. She replied that she was not and requested Viola to succeed her as the crown princess before Luffy broke her out of the palace. The citizens of Dressrosa were outraged at what they believed to be a kidnapping and chased after Luffy and Rebecca. The Marines shot at Luffy but collapsed due to Mansherry drawing their blood. Luffy dropped Rebecca off at Kyros' house, where she confronted him as he was about to leave the island. Kyros stated that she should not live with him because of the crimes he had committed, but Rebecca replied that she did not care as she embraced her father, wanting to live together with him. Back in the palace, Viola told Doldo about Rebecca's decision.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
