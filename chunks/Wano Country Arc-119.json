{"content": "Outside the castle, Kikunojo managed to strike Kanjuro down. Kin'emon and Denjiro then arrived shortly after, with the former leaving his kasa over Kanjuro's body as a form of condolence. Noticing Izou's presence, Kin'emon welcomed the Whitebeard Pirates' division commander to their team as they finally invaded the stronghold. Inside the castle, Orochi's men quickly swore allegiance to Kaidou, becoming members of the Beasts Pirates. Kaidou then proposed to spare Momonosuke under the condition that he admitted that he was not Oden's son, having been previously disappointed by the boy twenty years prior. Momonosuke, in tears, admitted his heritage out of pride, even though that would lead to his execution. After spectators were surprised by an explosion produced by Yamato's then-removed handcuffs, the Nine Red Scabbards appeared behind the execution platform and managed to pounce on the Emperor before he could kill Momonosuke, officially beginning the invasion of Onigashima.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
