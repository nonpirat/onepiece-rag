As stated by Law, the World Government has been doing human growth projects for hundreds of years as a method of creating an army of super soldiers.\n\t- It was later discovered that Big Mom ordered and financed the renewal of that research for her own personal reasons.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
