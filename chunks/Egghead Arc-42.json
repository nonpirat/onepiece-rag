{"content": "Just as a burnt up Kaku yells at Stussy for again mentioning things too late, Atlas charged at them and wound up for an attack, but Lucci quickly transformed into his hybrid leopard form and used Rokuogan on her, instantly knocking her out and badly damaging the large robot. At this point the Jinbe, Chopper, Luffy and the still unconscious Bonney ran right in front of the agents, with Lucci and the rubber man instantly recognizing each other. While temporarily surprised at each other's presence, Luffy quickly ran towards Atlas in concern, and seeing her condition, requested Chopper to take care of her. Kaku cautioned Lucci from engaging them, as Luffy was now considered an Emperor, and that they were not permitted to engage one without approval from their superiors, as it could potentially lead to an unwanted war, however a fight soon broke out regardless as the Straw Hats went to support their assassination target.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
