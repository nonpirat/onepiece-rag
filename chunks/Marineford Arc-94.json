{"content": "Ace smiles one last time and dies, falling from his brother's arms as the last fragment of his Vivre Card burns away.\u00a0Luffy remembers when Ace punched him on the head in the past for crying when he thought Ace was dead, after which Ace made a promise not to die and leave his weak little brother alone. Now back in the present, kneeling by his brother's body, Luffy raises his head and howls in anguish.\n\nThe Whitebeard Pirates, along with the entire Sabaody, are shocked at the death of Ace. Luffy is unmoving and unresponsive as Ivankov calls out to him. Seeing that all the damage Luffy has received has now taken its toll, Ivankov surmises that the shock has collapsed Luffy's mind. Akainu takes the opportunity to once again try to kill Luffy, but Marco intercepts him and yells at Jinbe to take Luffy away.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
