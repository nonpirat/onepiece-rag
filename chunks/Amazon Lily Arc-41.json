{"content": "Brook awakens on Namakura Island, the land of poverty in the Grand Line. He finds demonic cultists around him, who think that he's a demon that they have attempted to summon in a ritual. They ask of him to destroy their enemies who robbed them, but Brook is only concerned about \"getting back to the others\". The cultist's get afraid and beg him not to go back to the \"Demon Realm\" with the other demons. They give Brook a sacrifice, a scared pretty girl. Brook asks her to see her panties, and all the cultists rush to find panties for \"Satan-sama\", as they call him.\n\nIn the East Blue on the bridge Tequila Wolf, Robin is questioning the foreman about the bridge and finds out it is where prisoners or citizens of countries that did not join the World Government end up. He says that they are brought there to build the bridge, which has been in construction for over 700 years. He then tells Robin to start working and it shows her in shackles.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Amazon Lily Arc.txt", "title": "Amazon Lily Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 514 to 524"}}
