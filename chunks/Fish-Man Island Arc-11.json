{"content": "Everyone goes to the bow. Luffy asks what the current looks like. Franky, in response to seeing it, marvels at Mother Nature's creation, the great Downward Plume. Caribou, who had been quiet the whole time, stands up and tells the Straw Hats to turn back immediately, saying that something is wrong.\n\nLuffy says he sees a monster at the bottom. Caribou claims that he has never heard of a sea monster living in a downward plume. The monster in question is a Kraken, a giant, mythological octopus. Franky adds that it can crush multiple ships in a single blow and that it must have been staying there, feeding on the ships that traveled there in the past few days. Luffy, not intimidated by its massive size and appearance, decides to tame it.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
