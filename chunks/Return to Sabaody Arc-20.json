{"content": "Back on the newly coated Thousand Sunny, newly refurbished, Nami, Usopp, and Chopper meet up with the rest of the crew. Usopp holds Chopper as he gawks at the new upgrades on Franky, who now sports concealable hands within his giant ones and a hair-frizz feature. Nami is overjoyed to see the real Robin again and, to a lesser extent, the real Franky. Rayleigh and Shakky show up. Shakky updates the current crew on deck, where the others are, and the situations on the archipelago. Rayleigh approaches Nami, intent on teaching her how to navigate a coated ship. Usopp, worried since Luffy has not shown up, asks about him. Rayleigh responds with a smile that Luffy has already arrived.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Return to Sabaody Arc.txt", "title": "Return to Sabaody Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 598 to 602"}}
