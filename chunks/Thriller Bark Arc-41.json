{"content": "Usopp fires a shot at the real Perona but misses and Perona then launches an attack with a gigantic exploding ghost and then goes back into her body. Usopp stores the explosion in his impact dial and Perona find herself unable to move, as she is glued to the wall, due to Usopp's \"dud\" shot. A mustached hippo attacks Usopp, whom he hits with the stored impact. Usopp then shoots his \"Shiny Black Star\", a bunch of cockroaches (that are actually fake), at her and then hits her with his 10-Ton Hammer that is actually a balloon on an inflatable stick. She collapses from the shock, as Usopp leaves her behind.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Thriller Bark Arc.txt", "title": "Thriller Bark Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 442 to 489"}}
