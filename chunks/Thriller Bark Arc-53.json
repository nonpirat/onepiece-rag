They inform Luffy that Moria is now inside Oars' stomach and the only way Luffy can beat Moria is to beat Oars first. They proceed to place a shadow into Luffy stating that once purified, they are easy to capture and ask Luffy if he is good with a sword, Luffy says he is not while demonstrating amazing swordsmanship.
