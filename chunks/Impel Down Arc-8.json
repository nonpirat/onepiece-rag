Yet, Luffy defeats him in a single attack and saves Buggy, who was extremely shocked he took the guard down so quickly, remarking Luffy's improvement from the last time they met. Buggy then remembers the other four Blugori, only to realize Luffy had already defeated them. Buggy initially decides to escape, but after hearing Luffy mention the battleships waiting outside the prison, he decides to stay. Buggy suddenly spots the arm band that Luffy is wearing and immediately identifies it as the map to Captain John's treasure.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
