{"content": "After leaving Skypiea, the crew eventually traveled to Fish-Man Island, where they met Neptune and Shyarly, who prophesied future events. Neptune then took the Roger Pirates to the Poneglyphs at the Sea Forest: a Road Poneglyph and Joy Boy's apology, but they were surprised to not find the one of the Ancient Weapons, Poseidon there as Skypiea's Poneglyph had said. Neptune revealed another prophecy about a mermaid who could talk to Sea Kings that would soon be born, and assumed it was his daughter that was also prophesied. Shyarly then told Roger per his request that the Mermaid Princess would be born in 10 years, much after Roger's death.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
