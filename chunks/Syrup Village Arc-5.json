{"content": "Just before the two could be killed, Zoro and Luffy arrive and fight Kuro's crew. Jango hypnotizes the crew to increase their strength, but accidentally hypnotizes Luffy as well, turning him into even more of a threat. Jango is forced to hypnotize Luffy to sleep again to stop him, but accidentally causes the crew to be knocked out by the ship's stempost, which Luffy was holding onto when he fell asleep. Meanwhile, Kaya finds the wounded Merry, who informs her of Klahadore's identity, and, realizing she was wrong about her accusations against Usopp, heads out to find Kuro and talk to him. Usopp's crew figures out that his earlier lie about a pirate attack was actually a lie. They notice Kaya walking out of the village and begin to follow her.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Syrup Village Arc.txt", "title": "Syrup Village Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 22 to 41"}}
