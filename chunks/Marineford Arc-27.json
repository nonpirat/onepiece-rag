{"content": "Having also received the order, Koby and Helmeppo start to panic, but before they can react, the two notice something falling from the sky. Ace and the Marines see it too. As the object plummets closer to the ground, it is revealed that it's none other than Luffy and the escapees descending from above. As they plummet down, Luffy exclaims that he is not worried since he is made of rubber, but the others are distressed, yelling at him to do something before they make impact with the ice beneath them.\n\nBy sheer luck, the battleship lands in one of the few spots of ocean that remain unfrozen. Although the impact splits the boat in two, those on board fall into the ocean unharmed. Jinbe dives underwater to rescue the Devil Fruit users, as the others make their way up onto the wreckage.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
