Zoro manages to bargain for the hostages' freedom in exchange for them finding the rest of the Straw Hats and coating their ship so they can leave peacefully. Fukaboshi agrees to the demands and reveals the message that Jinbe left. The messages are \"Do not fight Hody\" and \"I'll be waiting in the Sea Forest.\" Back at Coral Hill, the news of the Straw Hats' actions has reached the residents' ears. The Ammo Knights try to arrest Sanji and Chopper. Chopper attacks the knights with his new Kung Fu Point. Sanji then questions the guards, asking if the Mermaid Princess is at the palace. When they confirm it, Sanji tells Chopper that he is going to head to the palace. Chopper scolds Sanji, saying that if the Mermaid Princess is beautiful, he will die instantly.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
