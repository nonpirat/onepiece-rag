{"content": "Meanwhile at the main entrance of Impel Down, the others have reached topside and have taken out the guards. Bon thinks it is clear sailing from there, but Mr. 1 tells him otherwise mentioning the battleships that await the group when they get outside. The other prisoners, however, are more than pumped for a fight and prepare for the worst as they open the gate. Much to their surprise, they find no guards waiting for them and there are no ships as well, Crocodile realizing that Magellan sent the Marine ships away to prevent the prisoners' escape. Just as the group begins to despair, Jinbe mentions that the order wasn't too long ago, so the ships have not gotten very far. He points out a ship just barely on the horizon. When asked how they'll reach it, Jinbe takes out one of the entrance doors, gives one of the prisoners a Den Den Mushi then jumps into the water.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
