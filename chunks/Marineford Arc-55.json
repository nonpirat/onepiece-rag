{"content": "As Squard appears on the Moby Dick, Whitebeard asks if he is unharmed, as he has not been able to contact him. Squard apologizes, reporting that the pirates in the rear have been hit badly. Whitebeard states that they have the Marines where they want them and that he will fight alongside the others. Squard says that all of them owe him a great debt and that they'll give their lives for the Whitebeard crew. Marco, having just noticed that someone was on the ship with Whitebeard, casually turns to face him. Squard suddenly impales Whitebeard through the chest with his blade, horrifying Ace, Luffy, Jinbe, Ivankov, Buggy, all of the Division Commanders, and all the onlookers at the Sabaody Archipelago. While Mihawk, Sentomaru, and the Admirals remain unfazed, Doflamingo and Moria take great pleasure in witnessing the assault.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
