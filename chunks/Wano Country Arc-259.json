{"content": "Throughout all this chaos, Jinbe and Raizo prepared to carry out a plan to save everyone. As it turned out, during Raizo's stay at Zou, the ninja used his Maki Maki no Mi abilities to store an immense amount of water from Zunesha's eruption rain. He did this in hopes of never allowing what happened to Kuri Castle twenty years ago to ever happen again. On the Fourth Floor, Raizo used Ninpo: Maki Maki no Jutsu: Elephant's Bath Return to unleash the eruption rain at Jinbe, who took control of the deluge and spread it around the castle with Mizugokoro: Gyojin Jujutsu: Kairyu Ipponzeoi, putting out as much of the fire as possible.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
