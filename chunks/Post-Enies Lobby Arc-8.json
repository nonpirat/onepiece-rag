{"content": "Meanwhile, in \"The New World\", Marines report Red-Haired Shanks breaking through a Naval Blockade between himself and Whitebeard. As there is nothing else, they can do to prevent the reunion, they stand by. Shanks is about to meet Whitebeard and does some kind of big entrance, defeating the lower ranked ones of his crew with nothing more than his Haki. As both of them begin their conversation, it is revealed that Shanks and Buggy were in fact members of Gol D. Roger's crew and had been in numerous battles with Whitebeard's crew. Whitebeard says just about everyone was astounded when he came back from East Blue without an arm, to which Shanks replies he had it bet in the \"new era\". Shanks tells Whitebeard the only scar he was still angry about was the one in his eye, made neither by Hawk Eyes nor by any other enemy but the one and only Blackbeard. They proceed to discuss the menace represented by that man. Shanks makes a shocking statement, asking Whitebeard to summon back Ace, in fear for his security.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-Enies Lobby Arc.txt", "title": "Post-Enies Lobby Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 431 to 441"}}
