{"content": "The next morning, Ichiji and Niji arrived at the Germa Kingdom, and the Vinsmoke Family had a meal together. There, Sanji was angered when Niji scraped some of his food onto the floor and attempted to throw his plate at the head chef, Cosette. However, Sanji was prevented from acting further by Judge, who revealed that Germa had sent assassins to the East Blue who would take out Zeff upon command. After the meal, Sanji discovered that Cosette had been brutally beaten, and Yonji offered to take him to see Niji. Yonji took Sanji to a laboratory where Germa grew its clone soldiers, and Sanji was then confronted by Niji and Ichiji. Sanji attacked Niji, but was quickly overpowered by his three brothers and left injured in the laboratory.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Whole Cake Island Arc.txt", "title": "Whole Cake Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 825 to 902"}}
