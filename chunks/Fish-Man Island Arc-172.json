{"content": "Back at the plaza, the pirates are showing their worry for their captain. But Hody gets back up from the attack he received from Luffy and tries to take his head off with Fish-Man Karate. It only succeeds in knocking Luffy's head back thanks to his rubber body. Luffy coats his forehead with Armament Haki just as a few fish-man try to shield Hody with Iron Shells. But Luffy hits them with his Gomu Gomu no Kane attack which, thanks to the Armament, knocks them out. Hody tries to rush in and kick Luffy, but Luffy uses the Armament on his arm and blocks the attack, injuring Hody's leg. Luffy then flips and hits Hody with his Axe attack coated with the Armament as well, smashing him into the ground. Hody gets back up and rapidly fires water shots at Luffy. But the Straw Hat dodges them easily much to the astonishment of the pirates. Luffy then hits Hody with an Armament-powered Pistol attack sending him flying into a wall.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
