{"content": "During the Levely, back at Mary Geoise, Karasu (revealed to be the wielder of the Susu Susu no Mi), Lindbergh, and Morley freed as many slaves as they could and kept the Admirals, Fujitora and Ryokugyu busy, while Sabo, who went to retrieve the slave collar keys, spotted Kuma with Saint Charlos while doing so. As that was going on, Cobra went to go talk with the World Nobles leaving Vivi to be looked after by CP0, though she refused their service after seeing their inaction to step in to save Shirahoshi earlier from Saint Charlos. As Cobra proceeded to the Elders room, Pell and Chaka were refused to be allowed to come with him. Cobra dismissed them, telling the two to look after Vivi, as he was worried about what she would get into.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
