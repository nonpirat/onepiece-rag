{"content": "At Arlong Park, Zoro has busted free from the dungeon (with help from Nami, who cut his bonds) and defeated all the Fish-Men. He meets the octopus Fish-Man\u00a0Hatchan, who is oblivious of what happened at the park, and, thinking Zoro is a corrupt Marine, tows him to Cocoyasi. However, after landing, he overhears some villagers talk about Usopp's attack on the Fish-Men and quickly tries to rush back to the park to save him. However, it is already too late, as the Fish-Men have captured Usopp and threaten to kill him. Nami happens upon the scene and threatens to kill Usopp herself. Usopp tries to get away with a smoke bomb, but Nami intercepts him, stabbing him with a knife, before kicking him into the ocean to drown. This convinces Arlong and the Fish-Men that she is indeed one of them, while from afar Johnny looks on in horror.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Arlong Park Arc.txt", "title": "Arlong Park Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 69 to 95"}}
