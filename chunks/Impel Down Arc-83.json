{"content": "Luffy proclaims he will not let Ace die and starts to attack again, but Blackbeard summons a black whirlpool sucking Luffy toward him and slamming him into the ground. Crocodile is surprised that Luffy actually bled from the attack since he's made of rubber. Before the fight can continue, Jinbe stops Luffy telling him that it is not the time and to think about his top priority also adding that Blackbeard was even able to take down Ace, a Logia user. This calms Luffy while Blackbeard is surprised at Luffy's strength and his increase in Haki. Crocodile speaks out asking that if Blackbeard is supposed to be a Warlord, then why was he not at Marine Headquarters which Blackbeard answers this is all part of his plan. Crocodile shrugs this off not really caring before the other prisoners announce that Magellan is closing in on the area. One of his poison Hydras manage to hit a few of the prisoners in the back prompting the group to continue on, Iva warning Luffy that if he is poisoned again, he will not survive", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
