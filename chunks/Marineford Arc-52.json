Before they can see much more, all but one video feed is cut. Sengoku commands that as soon as Ace is executed, the pirates must be wiped out at once. Luffy, rushing to get to Ace before he is executed, is stopped by Kizaru, who sends him flying with a kick of light. Luffy is caught by Jinbe, who encourages Luffy by saying that they knew their enemies would be strong from the start. Giving Luffy a moment of reprieve, a group of Whitebeard's Division Commanders rushes forward to stop Kizaru, who calmly states that the situation is terrifying.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
