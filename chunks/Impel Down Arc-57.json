{"content": "On the top levels, Sadi, her Jailer Beasts, and the rest of the staff have no luck in finding Bon. Eventually they report to Magellan that he has completely vanished while a few guards find the tied up Hannayabal. On Level 6, Jinbe doubts the information that Hancock had relayed to Ace, but Ace knows it's real since he knows Luffy better than anyone. Eight hours pass through all of this, and morning eventually arrives. Domino comes to remind Magellan that it is time to transport Ace. Back in Newkama Land, Luffy abruptly stops screaming which worries Iva. Blood suddenly seeps from the cave, prompting Bon and the others to take it as a sign he did not make it. Just as they start to mourn, the door to the room is suddenly pounded against. This is followed by Luffy yelling out for food, much to the joy of Bon and the others on the level as well as the astonishment of Iva who exclaims it has not even been a day since the procedure began.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
