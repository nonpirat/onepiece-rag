{"content": "The G-5 Marines berate Zoro and Kin'emon for creating a hole in the shutters that the gas can get into it. Meanwhile, Brook uses his astral form to observe the outside of the base and informs them that it is impossible to go outside without dying. The G-5 Marines repair the hole with boards and metal, then attempt to arrest Zoro, Brook, Usopp, Kin'emon, Nami (In Sanji's body), Sanji (in Nami's body) and Brownbeard. They are interrupted by Luffy, who asks if they are ready to start. Nami then asks Law if he can switch her back into her own body, along with Sanji (Sanji is obviously not happy about this) and Law agrees. Nami punches Sanji for peeping on her body by changing coats (in truth he had taken it off to dive into the lake to retrieve Kin'emon's upper body). Sanji notices he feels weaker which Usopp notes was from getting blown up by Caesar's explosive gas.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
