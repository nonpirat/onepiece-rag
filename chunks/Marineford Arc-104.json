{"content": "Crocodile reveals himself and uses Sables to throw Luffy and Jinbe into the air, claiming that if they were going to protect Luffy, they should do it right. The duo fly until they plow into Buggy, who was still escaping, much to his surprise. His followers took it to mean that he was trying to do it deliberately to save them. Just as he is gathering himself, Akainu fires a magma fist at them but is stopped by the Whitebeard Division Commanders, who declare that they'll protect Luffy.\n\nBuggy, meanwhile, is trying to decide where to go with Sengoku and the Blackbeard Pirates fighting on one side and Akainu and the Whitebeard Pirates on the other, during which Jinbe passes out from his wounds. He notices a submarine surfacing from the water outside Marineford. A figure calls out to Buggy, telling him to bring Luffy to him. When asked who he is, the figure reveals himself to be Trafalgar Law. He yells that he is there to help Luffy as he is a doctor.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
