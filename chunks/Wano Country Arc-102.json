{"content": "Just as Luffy, Law, and Kid stuck a devastating blow against the Beasts Pirates, Denjiro appeared. He cut off a large portion of the Beasts Pirates' ship and asked to bring his family to join the Nine Red Scabbards forces, revealing himself in the process. He revealed that he had released the 1,000 samurai trapped in the Rasetsu Town prison and brought them with him. Finally, he applauded Kin'emon's \"plan\": The two lines in Yasuie's message were not legs; they were cutting lines signifying cutting the center part out. When you remove the center kana of \u306f\u3076\u307f\u306a\u3068 the result is \u306f\u3068 or \"wharf.\" In other words, the true meeting place was a wharf hidden in a forest of Habu Port, where the other 4,200 soldiers were waiting. Kin'emon, however, was unaware of such a deception.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
