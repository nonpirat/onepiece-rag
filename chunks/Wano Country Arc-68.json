{"content": "In the Flower Capital, Orochi was enraged to hear that the Straw Hats had escaped, though Fukurokuju assured him that the Oniwabanshu and the shogun's samurai squad the Mimawarigumi were patrolling the city. Sanji and Shinobu watched the Rasetsu Town prison, whose occupants had not been freed even as the guards continued to doubt Orochi thanks to Yasuie. Meanwhile, Law had been brought into the prison after offering himself in exchange for his crewmates, threatening to sacrifice them to kill Hawkins otherwise. Bepo, Shachi, and Penguin found Nami in Ebisu Town, and gave her a copy of the secret message that had been altered by Yasuie. Nami noticed that he had drawn lines through the snake drawing, and said she would show it to Kin'emon as she departed for Amigasa Village with Franky and Kanjuro, who had Yasuie's body in his possession.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
