{"content": "Spandam, at first panicking and not realizing that he is still on air, started to gloat that the lives of the Marines do not matter as long as he can bring Robin alive to the Gates of Justice. Robin cut in on his broadcast with a warning to the Marines. Understandably alarmed, the listening Marines evacuated the island, leaving the Franky Family and Galley-La workers behind as prisoners.\n\nHearing Robin's warning, Luffy tried to force his way past Lucci to reach her, but Lucci fought back fiercely and stopped him in his tracks, forcing him to continue the fight. Jabra and Kaku decided to end their fight with Zoro and Usopp quickly in order to escape the approaching bombardment.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Enies Lobby Arc.txt", "title": "Enies Lobby Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 375 to 430"}}
