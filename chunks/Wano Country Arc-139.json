Kaidou then attempted to chomp on Law, who easily evaded and pierced a Gamma Knife where he believed the heart was in the dragon. Killer then got onto Kaidou's back and did some internal damage with Kamaa Sonic, until he was struck off by Big Mom and Zeus's Indra. Kaidou then attempted to bite Killer, but then decided to redirect a Bolo Breath at Luffy after receiving his Gomu Gomu no Rhino Schneider to the face. Zoro had a reluctant Law place him in the way of the attack, cutting the breath before immediately retaliating with an Hiryu: Kaen, which ended up missing and instead cut off one of the horns from the mountain. Big Mom then had Zeus use Tenman Daijizai Tenjin, which hit all her opponents but proved ineffective against Luffy, who charged at the Emperors. Kaidou then hit the Straw Hat", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
