{"content": "Spacey and his brothers arrive shortly after and, along with the ancient automata, thank Enel for awakening them. Enel then looks at the wall paintings and discovers its history: it turns out that the Skypieans, Shandians and Birkans, the latter being his ancestors, all originated from the moon city and invented the automata. After using up their resources, the inhabitants decided to travel to Earth while giving a tearful goodbye to their creations.\n\nThe automata then pledge their loyalty to Enel for reawakening them. Though Enel was still annoyed by this, he gave thought to the fact that he was surrounded by endless followers along with the Fairy Vearth that he'd long sought. Thus, he accepts their loyalty and stands tall as the leader of his new army.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Enel's Great Space Operations.txt", "title": "Enel's Great Space Operations", "Chapters": "Chapters 428 to 474"}}
