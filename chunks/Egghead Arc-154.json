{"content": "Soon, the Freedom Fighters invaded Sorbet, prompting Bekori to redact the enslavement policy, to which the citizens rejoiced. Two of the Freedom Fighters came to the prison and freed everyone, who Kuma and Ginny recognized as Dragon and Ivankov. Afterwards, the two accepted their offer to join the Freedom Fighters, which evolved into the Revolutionary Army. While the army was low on funds, they went in as mercenaries aiding rebellions into overthrowing their rulers. Dragon also offered to teach anyone joining the army on how to wield weapons. Kuma asked how he learned to use weapons, and Dragon said he used to be a Marine but defected since he did not find any justice there. Once in a while, Kuma would also visit Sorbet to check on the south's citizens.\n\nEight years later, the Revolutionary Army's East Army and its commander Ginny had planned to meet up with Kuma's group the next day. However, they were then hit by a surprise attack and reported to Dragon that Ginny had been captured in the process.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
