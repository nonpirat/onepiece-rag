{"content": "Luffy grabs hold of Buggy as they fall, while he throws Buggy's feet onto the ground as told, and they fly towards the entrance of Level 2, with Buggy's feet splitting apart to avoid the blade grass. Eventually the two reach a hole in the middle of the forest which Buggy explains leads to Level 2. Luffy immediately jumps down and heads towards Level 2 despite Buggy's warnings. Buggy shrugs this off and prepares to find another way to escape, but an attack by a pursuing Blugori knocks him into Level 2 as well.\n\nOn Level 2, we can see residing in a cell, none other than Mr. 3, appearing more ragged and with more facial hair than he had prior to his sentencing. He is surprised by the sudden rage of the Beasts of Hell on the level, but he does not care since he does not have the energy to be afraid anymore since all prisoners in Level 2: Wild Beast Hell are their food anyway.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
