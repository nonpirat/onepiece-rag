{"content": "Meanwhile, Luffy and the Impel Down escapees are trapped atop one of the frozen tsunami waves created by Whitebeard and Aokiji's powers. Luffy tries to talk the others into pushing the boat so that it will slide down the back of the wave. Before they do, though, the Den Den Mushi on board intercepts the order, which is to just ignore the schedule and execute Ace then and there. Panicking, Luffy tells the others that they need to hurry. Ivankov performs his Hell Wink in hopes of shoving the battleship off of the wave. However, instead of sliding down, it is knocked forward, flipping upside-down and sending all of the inmates plummeting towards the sea.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
