{"content": "With the money they gain from this, they admit Lucci to a hospital, where he remains unconscious for a few days, while the other agents spend their time shopping and sightseeing. After his recovery, CP9 goes to a bowling alley. There, a commotion outside alerts them of the invading Candy Pirates, whose captain captures a mother and daughter. CP9 then arrive and defeat the Candy Pirates with ease, as the townspeople look on in amazement. However, Lucci deals \"excessive justice\" to the crew's captain by crushing his head with his foot, causing the citizens to run away in fear. Knowing that they can't remain on the island anymore, they prepare to leave the island, but before they do, a girl comes up to them and presents Kalifa with a beautiful flower as thanks for saving her and her mother.", "metadata": {"source": "database/CP9's Independent Report.txt", "title": "CP9's Independent Report", "Chapters": "Chapters 491 to 528"}}
