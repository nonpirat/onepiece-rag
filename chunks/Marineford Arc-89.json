{"content": "Luffy attempts to rush back to Ace's aid but falls to his knees, dropping Ace's Vivre Card in the process. Jinbe notes that Luffy is at his limit. Unfortunately, this shifts Akainu's attention to Luffy, and he turns away from Ace to attack the younger brother. Ace, seeing that Akainu means to attack the defenseless Luffy, suddenly leaps in the way and takes the blow. Akainu's molten blow pierces Ace's entire torso. Luffy and Whitebeard's pirates look on in horror while Ace's Vivre Card burns to a scrap of paper.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
