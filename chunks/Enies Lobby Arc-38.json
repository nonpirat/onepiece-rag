{"content": "Vice Admiral Onigumo noted Lucci and Luffy fighting and ordered the fleet to target the ship they are on. He explained that if it's Lucci, then he will survive. A Marine objected to the idea, saying that 1,000 Marines are aboard the ship. The Vice Admiral killed the Marine on the spot, asking if he can protect the future from a criminal with his weakness. The ships begin firing, and the ship that Luffy and Lucci is on is hit. Luffy escaped the bombardment, returning to the tower. However, when he lands, he is shrunk from the side effects of Gear 3. He then hid from Lucci until he could return to normal size.\n\nSpandam mocked the pirate, thinking Luffy died in the attack, and continued to brag about the Buster Call until Franky punched him in the face. Angry, Spandam tried to attack Robin with Funkfreed in elephant form, but is stopped by Franky, who threw the animal back right on top of Spandam.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Enies Lobby Arc.txt", "title": "Enies Lobby Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 375 to 430"}}
