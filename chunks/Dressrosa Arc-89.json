{"content": "Law had joined the Donquixote Pirates with no reason left to live, and he went ahead with getting revenge on Corazon as he stabbed the executive in the back. He was spotted by Buffalo, but bribed him with ice cream to be silent. Meanwhile, Doflamingo had a nightmare about him, Corazon, and their father Donquixote Homing being persecuted by a mob for being World Nobles. Seventeen years before this time, and 33 years before the present day, Homing had decided for his family to leave Mary Geoise and live as commoners. However, an 8-year-old Doflamingo did not understand his new position and treated the commoners like he was still a noble, causing them to realize what his family was and persecute them. The Donquixote Family's mansion was burned down, and they were forced to live in a shack and scavenge for food as they hid from the townspeople. Doflamingo's mother died to sickness, and the townspeople eventually caught Doflamingo, Corazon, and Homing.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
