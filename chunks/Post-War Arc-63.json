{"content": "In Arabasta, the kingdom recently had pirate troubles, though the guards are keeping them at bay. Cobra, Vivi, and Karoo also found out about the news of Luffy after reading an article about him. In an unnamed town in an unnamed section of the Grand Line, we find Crocodile and Daz Bonez (Mr. 1) having just read the paper about Luffy. Crocodile decides to head back to the New World and asks Mr. 1 if he will join him, which he does. Finally, on another unnamed island in the Grand Line, Buggy has been reunited with his crew, having brought all the Impel Down prisoners with him. Buggy is touched that his crewmates were worried about him (though Alvida points out that they left him to die). Cabaji and Mohji introduce themselves to the new crewmates while Buggy shows Alvida Captain John's map. As he gloats, a bat suddenly arrives with a letter from the government addressed to Buggy. Mr. 3 reads it and tells Buggy he will not believe what it says.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
