{"content": "A shot suddenly rings out, stopping the commotion. Charlos has shot Hatchan with his pistol, much to the horror of the Straw Hats, Pappag, and Camie, who pounds furiously on her fishbowl. Charlos then begins to gloat while Luffy makes his way towards the World Noble. Hatchan tries to stop him, reminding Luffy about the promise not to harm them and citing the fact that he was a pirate and that he deserved it anyway. He apologizes further, stating he only wanted to make up for his past actions to Nami and help any way he can but only got in the way. Charlos hears enough and tries to shoot him again. Luffy, already angered, no longer restrains himself, and not caring about the rules anymore, gets up and punches Charlos in the face.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
