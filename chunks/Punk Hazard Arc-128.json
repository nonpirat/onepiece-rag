{"content": "In Building C, Monet feels it too but knows it will not be enough to destroy the island. She readies to hit the ignition switch, saying a silent goodbye to Doflamingo. At that point Caesar stabs the heart, but Smoker is not affected, and instead, Monet collapses and dies. Smoker inquires to Law why Caesar thought he had his heart, and a flashback reveals that Caesar had forgotten he had given Law Monet's heart as insurance they would not betray each other. After Law had defeated Smoker, he simply gave Caesar Monet's heart, who thought he gave him Smoker's heart. The trolley soon reaches the exit.\n\nMeanwhile the Donquixote Pirates have noticed that he has departed from Dressrosa and is flying across the ocean heading toward Punk Hazard having grown concerned when Monet did not answer his call. Upon realizing that Baby 5 and Buffalo are still alive, and the island still stands, he tells the pair that he will be there shortly.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
