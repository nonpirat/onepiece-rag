{"content": "The Straw Hats initially get which beach the Black Cat pirates are going to land on wrong. This is caused by Usopp's faulty assumption that the area where Kuro met Jango was the arrival point, unaware that the real landing point is on the other beach. This results in Usopp and Nami initially fighting the pirates alone, as Luffy gets lost on the way there and Zoro is stuck in their oil slick trap as a result of Nami using him to get out of it herself in a desperate attempt to make sure the Black Cat Pirates don't get to her treasure, which is on the other beach where their boats are.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Syrup Village Arc.txt", "title": "Syrup Village Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 22 to 41"}}
