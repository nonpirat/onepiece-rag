{"content": "In the meantime, in Mary Geoise, Doflamingo is teasing some unknown representative of the World Government, telling him that Moria, while on the verge of death, disappeared suddenly, to which the other replies that that's not a funny story. Doflamingo retorts that as a pirate, he can leave the Seven Warlords of the Sea whenever he wants.\n\nBack with Chopper, he decided to head back to Torino Kingdom. At first, he was disguised as someone named Chopper Mask, due to his being embarrassed at coming back so soon after he left, though the villagers assured him it was alright. After the disguise fails, he asks to stay and study the plants. As he goes to the library, he realizes the natives on the island are much more advanced than he thought. He hopes to use the knowledge he gains from them to help his captain and crewmates get stronger.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
