The difference between them being that while Arlong would not hurt his own kind, Hody has no such reservations especially if they feel compassion to humans. He also states a Levely that happens every four years is coming up and Neptune was to attend such. Jinbe question if Hody wishes to stop that, but Hatchan says there is much more to it. Before he can continue, Chopper spots a Den Den Mushi coming out of the forest. Den states it is a visual one hooked up to a monitor, Hody's image then comes on a nearby TV screen, and he begins to address the entire island.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
