{"content": "Nami (still in Franky's body) insists that Luffy has nothing to do with Law. Luffy accepts the offer, after Law tells him who their target is. When they go back to the rest of the crew and explain, Usopp and Chopper are fervently against it, while Robin simply agrees but warns Luffy that there is a chance that Law may betray them. When Luffy questions Law if he would, Law replies no. Luffy then proudly states that even if Law is not a \"good guy,\" Luffy trusts his crew and their strength, shamelessly flattering them into agreeing. Law then returns Chopper and Franky's \"hearts\" to their bodies, while Nami's is shifted to Sanji's (much to her dismay) since her body was not present. Robin is glad that Franky is out of Chopper, while Chopper is angry at Luffy and Franky (who were blaming each other) for causing such damage to his body.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
