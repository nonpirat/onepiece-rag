{"content": "As onlookers wonder why the quakes are not affecting the execution platform, they see that the three Admirals are somehow holding it together, as the three banter about how it is each other's fault that the wall is not up yet. The pirates finally make it towards the city when dozens of walls shoot up from the ground, blocking their path. As much as the pirates try to attack it, the wall will not budge. Cannons emerge from the walls, preparing to fire. However, one wall near the front remains open, with Oars Jr.'s body blocking the wall's path and his blood interfering with the system. Although the situation is not ideal, Sengoku commands Akainu to attack anyway. Akainu uses Ryusei Kazan, causing a storm of flaming fists to rain down upon the pirates.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
