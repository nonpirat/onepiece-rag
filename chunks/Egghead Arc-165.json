Kuma then told Bonney that since he was a pirate, he could not stay in the country and would return next year, while in the meantime he would write many letters to her. Just then, they were greeted by a group of Cipher Pol agents posing as doctors. The leading CP8 agent as a nurse Alpha claimed they would watch over Bonney until she recovered from the disease. Though she acted nice towards Bonney, she set up protection around the church to prevent strangers without identification from entering, while she reminded Kuma that Bonney was now a captive of the government. Lastly, Kuma thanked Bonney for being born as he bid everyone farewell.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
