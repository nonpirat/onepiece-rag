{"content": "Caribou's Kehihihihi in the New World, Chapters 674 to 731, Volumes 68 to 73.\n\n\nLong Summary\n\n\nDuring another peaceful day at Mermaid Cove, a scream is heard as a shadowy figure chases after two others. Upon a closer look, the figure is revealed to be Caribou, who began another mermaid kidnapping spree using his swamp powers after recovering from his defeat at the hands of Pekoms. However, Jinbe arrives and easily defeats him with his Fish-Man Karate. He then chains the pirate up in a barrel and prepares to deliver him to the Marines on a coated boat, waving goodbye to the inhabitants while Caribou fumes at being defeated again. As they are traveling to the surface, Caribou's younger brother, Coribou suddenly arrives with the rest of the Caribou Pirates on a newly built Numabou to rescue his brother from Jimbe, making Caribou elated. However, Jinbe gets out and uses his swimming skills to quickly flee from them while hanging on the boat with Caribou still inside, much to the pirate's displeasure.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Caribou's Kehihihihi in the New World.txt", "title": "Caribou's Kehihihihi in the New World", "Chapters": "Chapters 674 to 731"}}
