{"content": "The Marines notice Law and label him as Luffy's accomplice. While Law is urging Buggy to get Luffy and Jinbe on board his submarine, Buggy questions who he is once more. The Marines immediately begin attacking Law's ship. Orders are given on the ground to divide the Marines' forces to attack the Blackbeard Pirates and the Whitebeard Pirates. Meanwhile, more Marines begin emerging from trap doors that lead to underground passages. Blackbeard laughs and shakes up Marineford and the ocean around it, creating massive waves. Jesus Burgess warns Blackbeard that they'll lose their footing if he continues on, but Blackbeard ignores him. He threatens Garp and Sengoku that he is going to \"close the book\" on them like he did with Whitebeard.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
