{"content": "In the Whole Cake Chateau's Room of Treasure, Sweet Commander Charlotte Smoothie was stationed to guard Big Mom's Poneglyphs along with Tamago and several other fighters. Brook spies into the room with his soul projection and sees the security, and he and Pedro decide that Pedro will provide a distraction. Pedro created a ruckus outside the room, causing Tamago and some of Big Mom's forces to pursue him. This caused Smoothie to be lured out of the room and locked out by Brook, who confronted the forces still inside and swiftly overwhelmed the homies with his Yomi Yomi no Mi abilities. Big Mom then received a signal from her hat Napoleon that there was an intruder in the Room of Treasure, and as Brook was copying down the Poneglyphs after having taken all the guards out, she barged into the room and confronted him.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Whole Cake Island Arc.txt", "title": "Whole Cake Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 825 to 902"}}
