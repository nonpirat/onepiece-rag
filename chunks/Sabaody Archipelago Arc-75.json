Angered, Sanji rushes to Kuma again but is vanished as well. Luffy is quickly losing his morale after seeing four of crew disappear right before his eyes while Rayleigh continues to battle Kizaru.\n\nKuma passes by them and whispers something to Rayleigh prompting him to question what he is doing. Kizaru inquires as well but Kuma brushes him off. Luffy then enters Gear 2, Kuma ignores him and goes for Franky and Nami. Franky launches a Strong Right striking Kuma directly in his face but showed no sign of harm to him. Luffy launches himself at Kuma in Gear 2 with a strong punch, but Kuma catches his fist easily and tosses him side.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
