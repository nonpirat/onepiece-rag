{"content": "Chased to the surface by the creature, Luffy defeats it easily with his Gomu Gomu no Rifle, which made it spit out a small mermaid (who lands right on a super-excited Sanji) and a starfish. The mermaid, revealed to be named Camie, introduced herself by trying to sell the crew some takoyaki. Camie, after having introduced herself and her talking starfish, Pappag, calls Hatchan, but is shocked when someone else answers his Den Den Mushi. The Macro Pirates have caught Hatchan, intending to sell him into slavery. Camie wishes to save him and Luffy agrees to do so, after consulting with Nami.\n\nCamie uses her ability to be able to speak with fish and navigates the ship towards Grove 44 of the Sabaody Archipelago, having been told that Hatchan is being held at the base of the Flying Fish Riders, which lies on this route. Before they arrive, they are attacked by the Flying Fish Riders, who after a brief battle return to their base to report back to their leader, Duval, an extremely tall man in an iron mask.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
