{"content": "The Newkama Land citizens cheer that they will finally be able to head forth to the Kamabakka Kingdom now that the war is over, and they are finally free. Ivankov informs Hancock of the trials he had to endure in escaping Impel Down, and how the death of Ace would crush anyone's mind. This prompts Hancock to muse to herself, wishing that she could have instead been in Luffy's place. When Ivankov asks Law why he saved Luffy, he claims that he had no obligation, and Ivankov understands that he had done it without thinking.\n\nJinbe emerges from the submarine, thanking Law for saving his life. Although Ivankov tells him to rest, he says that he cannot, for his heart is in too much turmoil. He worries not about Luffy's current condition, but rather more about what will happen when he awakens. Hancock demands that Bepo give her a Den Den Mushi so she can call the Kuja Pirates to carry them across the Calm Belt to Amazon Lily. There, Luffy should be able to recover without possible discovery by the Marines.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
