{"content": "Meanwhile, on Puffing Tom, Sanji tries to decide the best course of action when he is found by an agent. He kicks the agent through the cart, drawing the attention of everyone there. One of them suggests alerting CP9, but the CP6 agent Jerry, a very tall man that needs to bend over to fit in the cart, says that there's no need to do that. He tries to fight Sanji only to be beaten without any effort. In the car where CP9 is staying, Corgi explains that in the 5th car is the Marine Captain T Bone, in the 4th Wanze of CP7, and finally in the 3rd the newest member of CP9, Nero, making it so that there is no chance of any attackers reaching them.\n\nBack at Water 7, Luffy decides that they are going to take a ship to chase after Robin, but Paulie points out it is useless since no ship can get past a normal Aqua Laguna and this year's is far beyond average.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Water 7 Arc.txt", "title": "Water 7 Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 322 to 374"}}
