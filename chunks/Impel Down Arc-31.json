{"content": "One of the guards reports Luffy having reached Level 4 and avoided the pool by the debris he and his group fell on. He also reports Minotaurus' defeat which shocks Sadi. Upon hearing this Magellan stations Hannyabal at the Level 3 stairs and Sadi at the Level 5 entrance to keep the group from proceeding or heading back, while Magellan sends the rest of his guards to pursue the group, giving them permission to kill them (though Sadi wants them kept alive for torture purposes). Meanwhile Luffy's group are on a bridge near the Lake of Blood. Luffy suddenly heads in another direction from the group which Bon realizes is where the kitchen is, undoubtedly the smell of which has attracted Luffy. Guards spot him and rush his way, but Luffy easily takes care of them. In the sidelines, Mr. 3 talks to Buggy noticing the guard's formation and fearing that they'll be locked on the level with Impel Down's \"All Stars\".", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
