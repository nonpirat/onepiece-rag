{"content": "Mr. 3 quickly forms a key out of wax in an attempt to free Ace. Thinking of Bentham's sacrifice, Mr. 3 asks Luffy if he would laugh at him if he stated that he was there to avenge a fallen comrade. Luffy, of course, says that he would not. Just as Luffy receives the key, the Marines open fire on the scaffold, attempting to finish off all three. They think they have succeeded in their attack because Ace could not have survived being unable to use his Devil Fruit powers. Suddenly, they see a tunnel of flame emerging from the explosion, revealing a freed Ace grabbing on to Luffy (with Mr. 3 in tow) and scolding him later on how reckless he always is.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
