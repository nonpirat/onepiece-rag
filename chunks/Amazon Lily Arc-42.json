Chopper, rendered immobile due to the aftermath of Monster Point, falls out of their nest to avoid being eaten.

They attempt to eat him but stop when they realize he can speak.\n\nPerona is shown on Kuraigana Island, complaining about not having any servants with her. Suddenly, she hears a crash and sees that Zoro has crashed there, much to her discomfort. She bandages him up and puts him on a bed, and when he wakes up, he asks for his swords, but she refuses to give him his weapons.\n\nThough the story moves back to Luffy, the Straw Hats' separate adventures continue on their own cover stories.\n\nStory Impact", "metadata": {"source": "database/Amazon Lily Arc.txt", "title": "Amazon Lily Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 514 to 524"}}
