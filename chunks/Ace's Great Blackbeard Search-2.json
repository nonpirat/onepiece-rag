The Marines are very worried because top-secret documents are on the scout ship, when one of them jumps into the conflagration. The Marine turns out to be Ace, who was immune to the flame thanks to his abilities. He carries some documents as well as an unconscious Marine out while still on fire. However, this causes the Marines to quickly deduce Ace's identity and chase him down again, but he was able to evade their attacks thanks to his Logia powers. Before escaping, Ace hands Moda's letter to Comil, the intended recipient, while still being shot at.\u00a0Comil reads Moda's letter, which asks the Marines if they would like to buy her milk.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Ace's Great Blackbeard Search.txt", "title": "Ace's Great Blackbeard Search", "Chapters": "Chapters 272 to 305"}}
