{"content": "Hatchan reunites with Camie and Pappag, but they are attacked by a Flying Fish Rider, though they are quickly saved by Zoro. Hatchan thanks Zoro for rescuing him and tries to apologize for the events in the past. Usopp defends the ship by using a cannon to shoot down the flying fish, with Chopper praising his skill. As the Straw Hats find out that there are a multitude of Flying Fish Riders in the sky, Brook becomes ashamed that he cannot lend a hand in his first fight as a Straw Hat pirate. He then unsheathes his blade and jumps high in the sky and uses his violin to unleash a musical sound wave that puts the riders as well as Chopper and Luffy to sleep.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
