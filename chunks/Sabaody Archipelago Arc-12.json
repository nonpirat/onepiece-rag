{"content": "Duval shouts that he does not need the base anymore - his only wish is to kill the Straw Hats. He reveals that \"that man\" is none other than Sanji. The Straw Hat crew on the ship try to remember who he is, but Sanji draws a blank. Suddenly, Duval shoots his scorpion poisoned tipped harpoons at them and screams at him that it is something just recent - confusing Sanji even further.\n\nAs Sanji tries to tell Duval that he does not know him, Luffy tells Zoro that he has seen his face and that the whole Straw Hat crews knows this face well. As Luffy violently removes Duval's mask, it is shown to the whole crew and the riders that by a cruel twist of both fate and irony, Duval was born with a face that is a perfect replica of Sanji's wanted poster. Duval shouts that he wants his life back and that Marines and bounty hunters have been after him since the poster appeared, but Sanji, upon seeing the face, leaves the Sunny, swims to the base dock, and immediately kicks Duval in the face, claiming he does not care.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
