{"content": "Hannyabal continues to receive distressing news, this time of Iva's army rampaging through the prison and taking out anyone in their way. Luffy meets up with Bon as well as Mr. 1. Luffy does not recognize the latter, so Bon tells him of Mr. 1's defeat against Zoro. Luffy just shrugs it off since he has never met him until now. Hannyabal is in a panic as the Monitor Room keeps getting requests for backup for Levels 4 and 2, as the group charge on with no indication of stopping. As they do, Luffy yells to everyone that it's time to head for Marine Headquarters.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
