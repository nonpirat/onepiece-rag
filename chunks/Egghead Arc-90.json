{"content": "Meanwhile, Saint Charlos once more attempted to abduct Shirahoshi, this time with the help of Kuma backing him. Her brothers rush to her aid but are stymied by the former Warlord. Donquixote Mjosgard stops them, claiming if they attack him, that will put their kingdom in danger. Fortunately, Sai and Leo rush to Shirahoshi's rescue as, since they are not affiliated with any kingdom and are pirates, they do not have to worry about that stipulation. The two swiftly knocked out Charlos while Morley managed to grab Kuma and he and Karasu began their retreat. Back in the Empty Throne room, Imu decides to make their presence known, much to the Five Elders' shock that they revealed themselves and Cobra, who find them sitting on the supposed empty throne of the world.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
