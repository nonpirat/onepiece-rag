{"content": "Garp returns to Luffy's hometown only to hear that Makino's bar has been over-run by vicious mountain bandits. Those mountain bandits ended up being Dadan and her underlings. Dadan sees Garp and hits him with a wooden bat. Makino steps between Dadan and Garp before she can attack again. Makino then states that \"Garp could not save both Ace and Luffy even if he wanted to\" and \"Garp is the one truly suffering.\" But as soon as she says that, Dadan says, with tears in her eyes, that the one truly suffering the most is Luffy. Makino then remembers the very first time she met Ace and runs off in a face full of tears. As soon as she leaves, Garp states that Luffy is alive\u2014for now. The final words that come out of Dadan's mouth are that she will always support Luffy no matter what he does from that point forward and that he better not lose no matter what.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
