{"content": "The Sunny crew mourned Pedro's death, but could not do so for long as Big Mom and her fleet quickly caught up to them. In the Mirro-World, Luffy began fighting Katakuri, but Katakuri used his mochi powers to mimic Luffy's abilities and overwhelm him. Br\u00fbl\u00e9e and her subordinates then prepared to attack the Sunny through its mirrors, and after Katakuri prevented him from stopping them, Luffy contacted his crew through a mirror shard and told them to shatter all of the ship's mirrors and planned to meet back up with everyone on Cacao Island. The Sunny crew was attacked by a giant wave created by Big Mom, but Jinbe singlehandedly piloted the ship through the inside of the wave, successfully riding it out and escaping from Big Mom once again. The crew then shattered their mirrors, and everyone thought the Sunny had sunk, but Br\u00fbl\u00e9e overheard Luffy talking to his crew and realized they were still alive, causing her to contact Perospero.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Whole Cake Island Arc.txt", "title": "Whole Cake Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 825 to 902"}}
