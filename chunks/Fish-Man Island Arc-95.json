{"content": "Meanwhile on the Grand Line, the Sun Pirates encountered yet another marine ship and easily took down its crew. Rear Admiral Kadar called out to Tiger, demanding him to give back the ex-slaves. Tiger countered him saying that he had no proof that there were such people on his ship. The Sun Pirates then looted the ship. Tiger then sees Arlong about to murder a marine, under the reasoning for simply being a human. Tiger shouted for him to stop. At Marineford, Strawberry is reporting to Vice Admiral Borsalino (Kizaru), about Kadar's ship being sunk despite orders for it to just recon and come back. Strawberry stated that they were able to identify Arlong and Tiger and label them as very powerful which \"worried\" Borsalino.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
