{"content": "Now conscious, he finds himself being stared at by most of the residents who comment on his habits (as most have never seen a man before) misinterpreting them as how a normal man acts. Luffy especially shocks them when he takes back his straw hat from Sweet Pea using his stretching powers. After revealing his name, as well as answering a question on what's between his legs (referring to his genitals) which Luffy answers as \"Kintama\" (\"balls of gold\"), they are amazed and ask to give his genitals to them so that they can see. This makes Luffy freak out, claiming that they're trying to kill him. The Amazons then give him some new clothes due to his old ones being worn out. However, his new ones are rather girly-looking, and he freaks out.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Amazon Lily Arc.txt", "title": "Amazon Lily Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 514 to 524"}}
