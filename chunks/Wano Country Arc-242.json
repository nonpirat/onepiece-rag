{"content": "In the castle basement, Izou's battle concluded with a double knockout against Maha, with Guernica heavily injured. Though frustrated at this development, Guernica still planned to continue the mission to capture Robin, when he received a call from the Joseph. He conveyed a new order from the Five Elders, to assassinate Luffy, much to Guernica's shock, who claimed that it would be impossible for him to intrude in Luffy and Kaidou's duel. Joseph agreed, stating that the order was to prevent the worst-case scenario. As the two agents talked, X Drake had recovered enough, and approached the Guernica from behind, resolving not to die without showing some kind of results. Drake then stabbed Guernica in the back with his sword, which elicited him to ask the undercover Marine, why. The Red Flag responded by claiming that this was his justice, to which the agent claimed he was jealous, before freeing himself with Soru and felling Drake with a Shigan just below his throat.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
