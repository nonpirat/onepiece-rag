{"content": "Back outside, Caesar has beaten both Franky and Robin as well as Smoker and Tashigi, much to the distress of the remaining G-5 crew as they note that Caesar did not touch them. Caesar orders his men to tie up the five and that he will take care of the slime falling from the sky. Back up at the lake, Zoro and Brook have had no luck trying to combat the slime when the samurai suddenly doubles over in pain. In the water Sanji finds the samurai's body in the mouth of a shark which was causing the samurai pain. He pulls it free when the shark tries to attack again only to get caught in the poison from the slime in the water. Despite knowing it will strain Nami's body, Sanji uses Blue Walk to get himself out of the water before the poison closes in on him.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
