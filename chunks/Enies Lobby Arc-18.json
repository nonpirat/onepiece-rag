{"content": "Meanwhile, Franky and Fukurou's battle continued into the kitchen, each one trying to punch harder than the other. As the two swapped blows and taunts, Franky began to flag due to lack of cola, but their fight was interrupted by Kumadori and Chopper, who burst in through one wall. Chopper's first Rumble Ball has worn off, so he stalled Kumadori by locking him in an enormous fridge. He joined forces with Franky, and after \"accidentally\" giving the cyborg the wrong drink several times, Chopper gave Franky a full cola refill. Franky, now super-charged, punched Fukurou out of the building, and their fight continued outside, taking them down into the ocean and then high above the Tower, where Franky ended the fight with his Coup de Vent cannon. Franky then grabs the Number 4 key off of Fukurou's coat pocket.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Enies Lobby Arc.txt", "title": "Enies Lobby Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 375 to 430"}}
