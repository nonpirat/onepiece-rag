{"content": "- Lilith reveals that Green Blood still grants its user the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses.\n- A third type of Pacifista is introduced under Sentomaru's command, the Mk. III, which weaponizes resin bubbles for combat.\n- It is revealed that the World Government's actions on Egghead and the events of what is to be known as the Egghead Incident began three months ago, when information about Vegapunk researching the Void Century was leaked by a traitor, which would cause an event that would affect the entire world.\n\t- This led the Five Elders to deploy a CP0 squad consisting of Lucci, Kaku, Stussy, and S-Bear with the mission to eliminate Vegapunk and all his copies. Lucci thinks the mission could be connected to Lulusia's destruction. They also decide to kill Bonney as well due to her escaping the World Government too often.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
