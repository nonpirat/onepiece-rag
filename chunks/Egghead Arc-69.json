{"content": "Back at Egghead, in the city, the citizens ask Sentomaru why he deployed the Pacifista with the only answer Sentomaru can give being that the island is about to suffer the same fate of Ohara and hoped the Straw Hats can get Vegapunk off the island. Back in the Command Floor, Luffy, Zoro, Lucci and Kaku continue to battle the Seraphim, but their attacks did not seem to affect S-Hawk and S-Bear. Zoro noticed the two seem similar to King which Shaka surmises must have been the Lunarian, then named Alber, that had escaped with Kaidou in the past. Zoro informed the others about the flames on their back and their vulnerability once its off (humorously getting chided by them for not noticing the Lunarian features sooner during the fight). As the others re-engage the battle, Shaka heads off by himself, thinking he knew where Vegapunk was.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
