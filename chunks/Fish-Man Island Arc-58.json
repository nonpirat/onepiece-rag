{"content": "Meanwhile, Luffy, Megalo, and Shirahoshi continue to head for the Sea Forest. Shirahoshi is nervous but excited to be outside for the first time in ten years. Luffy then asks if there is anything fun in the Sea Forest. Shirahoshi replies that there is a grave that she has wanted to visit since it was built. At the Sea Forest, Jinbe sits in front of the grave while commenting on the growth of the princes and the princess still being trapped in the tower in the ten years since the grave's occupant's assassination, but no one has forgotten her ideals. As it turns out, the grave belongs to Queen Otohime, the wife and mother of the Neptune family.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
