{"content": "In this event, the teams of three from each pirate crew choose one of their members to be the 'Ball', and the other team has to try and knock the opposing team's ball into the goal once. This event forbids the use of weapons, as it is a sport, though other kinds of cheating are allowed.\n\nZoro and Sanji take on a team of 3 known as the Groggy Monsters. Chopper was to participate, but Foxy won him in the previous game. However, the Groggy Monsters use weapons and the referee pretends he does not see them. After much difficulty, mostly due to fighting between the two crewmates, and partly due to a bias on the referee's part against them, Sanji and Zoro team up and defeat the Groggy Monsters. The referee blows his whistle signifying Sanji and Zoro's victory. Luffy then takes Chopper back as their crew.\n\nThis event is a duel between the two captains. A cannon is spun to randomly determine the fighting area, and the goal is to knock the opposing captain out of the fighting area.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Long Ring Long Land Arc.txt", "title": "Long Ring Long Land Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 303 to 321"}}
