{"content": "The Donquixote Pirates quickly spotted the duo in the palace, and Sugar went to turn them into toys. Luffy and Law did not know who she was as she approached them, and on the King's Plateau, Usopp moved quickly to stop Sugar. He had Kanjuro draw him an effigy of the face he made to knock out Sugar the first time, and Doldo, Lepanto, and Hack went to slow down the mob heading for him. Usopp aimed with the help of Viola's sight, and he suddenly became able to see people's auras inside the palace. He fired his shot right as the mob caught him, and it successfully passed in front of Sugar and scared her into unconsciousness again before she could turn Luffy and Law into toys again. This also turned the nutcrackers back into their original bodies, with each one having been made from eight Donquixote soldiers.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
