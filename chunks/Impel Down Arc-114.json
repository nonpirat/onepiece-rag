{"content": "- Luffy begins his attempts to save Ace by going to Impel Down. On his way down, he meets old foes he has faced back in previous arcs including Buggy, Mr. 3, Mr. 1, and Crocodile. He met an old ally, Mr. 2 Bon Kurei as well as new allies who know Dragon: Ivankov and Inazuma, and a close friend to Ace, the Fish-Man Seven Warlord of the Sea Jinbe who all help Luffy save Ace in the Summit War of Marineford. Though he was the second Warlord of the Sea to be named back in the Arlong Park Arc, Jinbe is the final Warlord of the Sea to be fully shown.\n- Jinbe being a close friend to Ace is revealed and their past encounter is foreshadowed, which was later shown in the Marineford Arc. Whitebeard's protection of Fish-Man Island is introduced. Jinbe's connection to Whitebeard caused him to resign his position of Warlord of the Sea in the next arc.\n- Crocodile's grudge against Whitebeard is revealed as he was simply trying to help Luffy escape Impel Down so he can try to kill Whitebeard at Marineford.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
