{"content": "On the small sky island of Weatheria, Nami has returned to the Sky Scientists to apologize, in which she was declined, but due to the fact that she promised to jump over to the blue ocean, she makes them apologize for making her cry. She accepts and demands to have a house and do research about the weather. While researching, Haredas explains that the sky island moves to the will of the wind, that they are researching weather and that the center of weather phenomena is at the Grand Line. She promises not to be an ordinary navigator because the lives of her crew members depend on her. Nami also asks about a weather phenomenon called \"Rain of Lightning\" that is a phenomenon that occurs in the New World and insists on Haredas teaching her all about the Weather Balls and asks if they could be turned into a weapon. Haredas responds that she should never say such dangerous things.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
