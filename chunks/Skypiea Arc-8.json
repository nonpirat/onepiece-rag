Eventually, they reach a hand stature with the river branching off into four paths going through each finger, each labeled with a different ordeal: \"Ordeal of Swamp\", \"Ordeal of Iron\", \"Ordeal of String\", and \"Ordeal of Balls\". Luffy chooses the Ordeal of Balls, thinking that it sounds fun, and after a drop, they find themselves in an area of the forest with several cloud balls floating around. Each of the \"Surprise Balls\" contains a different object\u2014some contain snakes, other explosives, other harmless flowers, etc. At this point, the priest Satori appears and attacks them, but they find that he is somehow able to read their minds using an ability called \"Mantra\". After a long and difficult battle, they manage to get past his mantra by turning his own attacks against him. Sanji debuts a new move called Concass\u00e9 which is enough to knock Satori out.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Skypiea Arc.txt", "title": "Skypiea Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 237 to 302"}}
