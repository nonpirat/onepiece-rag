{"content": "- Aokiji mentioned Luffy's grandfather as a man who did him a favor. Luffy was terrified at the mention of him that he did not want to tell Usopp who he is. It would not be until the Post-Enies Lobby Arc that his grandfather was revealed to be Garp who already made an appearance in a cover story.\n- This arc was a take on a lightheartedness of the story before going into a dark arc. Also, this arc explores the relationship between Usopp and Luffy before the duel in Water 7.\n\t- Usopp is given the Straw Hat prior to Luffy's battle with Foxy, making him the only person aside from Nami that Luffy has entrusted it to.\n- The \"New Age...of unmatched power\" that Doflamingo was talking about in this arc was likely a reference to the production and usage of SMILEs, a name first mentioned to Disco just before Doflamingo abandoned the slave trade which would be further explored in the Punk Hazard Arc and Dressrosa Arc.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Long Ring Long Land Arc.txt", "title": "Long Ring Long Land Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 303 to 321"}}
