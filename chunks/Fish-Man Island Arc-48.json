{"content": "Usopp, Nami, and Brook are then seen after they subdued some of the Neptune Guards. Camie pleads with them not to fight anymore, but Usopp claims that the guards were the ones who attacked them out of the blue and that, whatever the reason, they will defend themselves. The Minister of the Left begs Neptune to use his power. Neptune does not wish to go against the pirates just because of a prediction, but decides to capture them. Neptune attacks, but Zoro intercepts him, having broken out of his prison upon hearing the \"party\" going on.\n\nBack in the Noah District, Decken arrives and goes to meet Hody. The two shake hands (though not before Decken puts a glove on to prevent his Devil Fruit from marking Hody as a target), symbolizing their joining of forces to bring down the Ryugu Kingdom.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
