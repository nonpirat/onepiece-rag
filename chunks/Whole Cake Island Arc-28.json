{"content": "Meanwhile, Zeus and Prometheus created a storm on the outskirts of Sweet City, and Big Mom's enraged army arrived to battle Luffy. Although Luffy's group managed to take down many of the Chess Soldiers with the help of Nami's Vivre Card, Luffy was eventually overwhelmed by the vast array of Devil Fruit users, and Nami was immobilized by Galette's ability. Luffy was then knocked out by Counter and Cadenza's punches, and after she had killed Kingbaum by slicing him in two, Amande took Nami's Vivre Card from her. The Big Mom Pirates then took Luffy and Nami to the Whole Cake Chateau, where they were imprisoned in a book in the Prisoner Library.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Whole Cake Island Arc.txt", "title": "Whole Cake Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 825 to 902"}}
