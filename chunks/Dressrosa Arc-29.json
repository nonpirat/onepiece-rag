An attacking party led by Giolla of the Donquixote Pirates attacked the ship to take it over and kidnap Momonosuke, and Giolla turned the team into living art with the Ato Ato no Mi. The team escaped the Sunny, which Giolla turned into a piece of art as well. On Green Bit, Law was overwhelmed by Doflamingo and Fujitora, and wondered why Nami was not answering the Den Den Mushi.
