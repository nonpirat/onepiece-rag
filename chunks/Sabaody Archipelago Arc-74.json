{"content": "The crew is completely shocked by Zoro's disappearance. Luffy demands to know what has happened to him to which Sentomaru unwittingly answers, telling him if a person touched by Kuma's paw, they go flying for three days though where they end up is uncertain. Sanji and Usopp continue to question where Zoro is just as PX-1 prepares to fire at them from behind. Kuma, however, warps to it and makes it disappear confusing both the Straw Hats and Sentomaru. Luffy yells for the remaining Straw Hats to run to which they oblige. Kuma however advances on the injured Straw Hats (Sanji, Usopp and Brook) prompting Brook to try to defend the latter two. However, he is vanished by Kuma.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
