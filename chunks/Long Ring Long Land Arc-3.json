{"content": "- The contestants for each event are chosen by the captains before the game begins and the contestants cannot be changed. Contestants can only participate in one event, though they can participate in two in the anime. Since the line-ups cannot be changed, the winning team can steal a crew member that is competing in the next event to give their team an advantage.\n- If a crew member is lost in one event, they can be won back in the next event, but not in future Davy Back Fights after the current one is over, unless the captains of both crews involved agree to another Davy Back competition.\n- All crew members that are won must immediately swear permanent allegiance to their new captain.\n- Any form of cheating is not allowed during the contests, and the Foxy pirates use this to their advantage by having their referee play dumb when they cheat, putting the Straw Hats at a major disadvantage.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Long Ring Long Land Arc.txt", "title": "Long Ring Long Land Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 303 to 321"}}
