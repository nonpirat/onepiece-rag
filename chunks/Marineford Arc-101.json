Before the fish-man can reach the boats, however, the water around them is frozen due to Aokiji. If that was not bad enough, Akainu suddenly bursts from the ground, declaring once again his intention of not letting Luffy get away and demanding Jinbe hand him over. Jinbe, of course, refuses, vowing to keep Luffy alive no matter what. Ivankov suddenly appears and tells Jinbe to step aside before hitting Akainu with a Hell Wink.\n\nA few Marines attack Blackbeard, but he knocks them out with darkness power. He then suddenly uses Whitebeard's earthquake power, much to the shock of everyone. When one of the pirates asks how this could be possible (as no Devil Fruit user can have two powers at once), Marco surmises that Blackbeard's body is abnormal and able to withstand the effects. Blackbeard makes a declaration of war to the entire world, claiming that it is now \"his age.\"", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
