{"content": "In the New World, Eustass Kid has just read about these events and questions Killer about what the 16 rings mean. Killer responds by explaining that the bell is sacred and that ringing it 16 times may represent the end of one era and the beginning of another. Kid takes this as meaning Luffy wishes to create his own era and sees it as a challenge against him. He then confronts some pirates he captured, the captain of which states he wishes to return to \"Paradise\" alive. Kid, however, responds by crucifying them, saying that pirates with no resolve should not come out onto that ocean.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
