{"content": "Whitebeard looks down on a terrified Squard, angrily asking how he could raise his sword against his father. However, instead of harming him, Whitebeard instead hugs his \"son,\" saying that even if he is a fool, he still loves him. When Whitebeard asks who it was who convinced Squard to turn against him, Squard reveals that it was Akainu, who had stated that he was opposed to the operation and that they only intended to kill Whitebeard and spare the others. He further tells Squard that, if opportunity presents itself, he should kill Whitebeard so that his crew will be unharmed. Whitebeard states that he knew how much Squard hated Roger, but that it was foolish to hold children accountable for the sins of their fathers and that Squard and Ace, as his family, should be good to each other.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
