{"content": "Bon goes around the level asking about Iva, and after a few dead ends, one prisoner tells him that he saw Iva head into the woods where Magellan's old office was. Bon heads that way dragging Luffy along, but once he's out of earshot another prisoner in the same cell mentions wolves roaming the forest, which gets a chuckle from the one who gave Bon the information, obviously having withheld this fact from the Okama. In the forest, Bon soldiers on, despite his body taking a beating from the cold, but determined not to let Luffy die. Wolves find and surround the two prompting Bon to fight them off the best he can, but there are too many and a few manage to bite him. Luffy wakes up, bites one of the wolves, then yells for them to get away. The wolves are instantly struck by his Haki and run away while Luffy faints. Bon is amazed at the feat Luffy just performed, but succumbs to his wounds and faints as well. However, as both men lose consciousness, a figure in an orange and white suit and hairstyle find them", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
