{"content": "In Building B, Chopper in his Monster Point is trying to block the berserk children from the Biscuits Room, telling them that they must not eat the candy. However, Chopper is unable to fight without hurting the children and is beaten down before the Rumble Ball wears off. At this point, Brook, Kin'emon, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Robin come to the rescue, and Chopper informs them that he is trying to prevent the children from getting their candy with the assistance of Mocha, who is trying to protect the candy. Robin then uses her Hana Hana no Mi abilities to stop the children from entering the room. However, the children simply beat the giant hands down and rush to obtain the candy. Mocha tries to tell them that the candy is bad for them, and that they need to listen to Chopper. When she tries to flee to the exit, Monet suddenly appears, blocking the exit with a snow barrier. Monet then tells Mocha not to keep the candy all to herself and that she should share the candy with the other children.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
