{"content": "Luffy's crewmates were excited about the proposition, but Luffy refused, asking if Momonosuke was really the heir and leader over the samurai or if he was just a crybaby. His crewmates came to Momonosuke's defense, but the young heir walked up to Luffy, remembering how his parents were killed, and cried that he wants to fight Kaidou. Momonosuke said he wanted to avenge his parents and protect his retainers, but asked Luffy to help him in the fight. Luffy accepted, forming an alliance between pirates, samurai, and minks called the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance, but stated that he wanted to get Sanji back first.\n\nMeanwhile, the minks begin to throw a party to celebrate the truce between Inuarashi and Nekomamushi, remembering when the two were once friends. Unbeknownst to them, however, Jack and his fleet sailed up to Zou, with Jack ready to finish his job. However, this time he would not rush onto Zou and instead would kill Zunesha.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Zou Arc.txt", "title": "Zou Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 802 to 824"}}
