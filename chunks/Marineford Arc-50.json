{"content": "Both pirates and civilians look on in horror as the Pacifistas arrive, as the only knowledge the pirates had was rumors that Vegapunk had been using human corpses to develop a human weapon. However, they are mystified as to why they are all Kuma. Sentomaru tells Kizaru that things were not going according to plan, as the pirates were meant to be all driven into the bay instead of being scattered as they were. As the pirates listen on, they realize that Whitebeard knew that the Marines were going to pin them all into the bay and had saved their lives when he told his men to split up. Sengoku demands that they continue with the plan, attacking any stragglers that they can reach. Sentomaru asks Kizaru if it is okay if the Pacifistas destroy some of the Marines' battleships as well, to which Kizaru simply replies that they should not destroy too many.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
