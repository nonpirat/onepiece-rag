{"content": "Back at the Straw Hats' hiding spot, the area is being bombarded by explosions. Chopper (in Sanji's body) and (Nami in Franky's body) have been left behind with the kids as they stated before while Luffy, Robin, Usopp and Franky (in Chopper's body) have headed to the main lab. Chopper tries to spot the enemy but cannot tell where they are. Luffy's group hear the explosions and, seeing the giant footprints in the snow, head back to aid their friends. Prompted by Nami, Brownbeard reveals that their assailants are the Yeti Cool Brothers, two mercenaries who can appear and disappear in a flash and kill whatever target for the right price, even Brownbeard has not seen their faces only knowing they are covered in hair.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
