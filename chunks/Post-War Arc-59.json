{"content": "Meanwhile, on the island of Namakura in the poor country of Harahettania, we find that Brook and the residents of the island have managed to imprison the Longarm Tribe, thanks to Brook's music, which helped them gain the courage to take them on. Brook congratulates the islanders on their success but secretly finds out about what happened at Marineford and is preparing to leave. When one of the islanders mentions making a show out of the Longarms to get rich, Brook objects and threatens the Longarms to stay away from the island lest they face his retribution. The Longarms agree and are let out of the cage. However, they capture Brook and run off with him, revealing that they do not believe in devils and plan to sell him off to their homeland. The Harahettania Islanders go to perform another summoning ritual while Brook thinks of Luffy, calling out for his help.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
