{"content": "The arc begins following the end of the Baratie Arc, with Luffy, Sanji, and Yosaku heading for Arlong Park on a small boat. To pass the time, Yosaku tells them about the Seven Warlords of the Sea and how this relates to their current destination. When Sanji doubts that Nami is heading there, Yosaku explains that they were able to estimate her course after he and Johnny had suspected the connection between the two before they were thrown off the Going Merry. The two had noticed that Nami had been interested in their copy of Arlong's wanted poster, and her behavior quickly became suspicious when they told her that Arlong recently had become more active. Meanwhile, Nami arrives at Arlong Park in the Going Merry. Once she arrives at the park's gate, a boy confronts her, trying to fight Arlong for the death of his father. Nami slaps him and gives him some money to make him leave. After this, Arlong and his crew are introduced, and it is revealed that Nami is part of Arlong's pirates.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Arlong Park Arc.txt", "title": "Arlong Park Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 69 to 95"}}
