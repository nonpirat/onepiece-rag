{"content": "Out at the Sea Forest, we find Franky with the Thousand Sunny, talking to an individual who explains that the forest is also a ship graveyard as the debris is brought in from the currents. The person in question is called Den, a Bering wolffish merman and Tom's younger brother. Den promises to coat the Sunny for him after hearing it was made from Adam Wood. Franky admits that he was surprised to find that he and Tom looked nothing alike. Den explains that fish-men and mermen have old genes in them so if for example, a shark mermaid was born from an octopus mermaid, that would mean his ancestor was a shark. Even so, no one on the island bats an eye about the different types of species. To them, family is family, and the fish-man cannot understand why humans would want to categorize them like that (though Den contradicts himself when he asks if Franky has a robot for an ancestor). Den goes on saying that he knows about Franky and Iceburg from the letters Kokoro sent him and knows what happened to Tom.
