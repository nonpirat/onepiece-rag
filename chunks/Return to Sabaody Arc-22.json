{"content": "In Grove 41, Franky contacts Sanji with Zoro, telling him where to meet up. When Zoro asks what's going on, Sanji slowly spells it out for him, causing a brief argument. However, it's interrupted when they notice some noise coming from a nearby island. In Grove 46, Fake Luffy is about to sic his pirates on the real Luffy, commenting that it'll serve as a warning to whomever crosses him, while Luffy asks Fake Zoro and Fake Sanji if he (Fake Luffy) is a friend of theirs. Before anything can happen, the Marines arrive and surround the pirates, ordering Fake Luffy's surrender. Fake Luffy orders Caribou and Coribou to use the Marine they wounded earlier as a shield to make an exit. Caribou, however, comments that it's too tall an order and kills the Marine right then and there, claiming it was punishment for lying about not calling the Marines.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Return to Sabaody Arc.txt", "title": "Return to Sabaody Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 598 to 602"}}
