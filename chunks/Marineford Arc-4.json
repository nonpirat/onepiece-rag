{"content": "Around the world, the audience is shocked to learn that Roger had a son and that his bloodline lives on to this day. Those on Marineford are rendered speechless, though those that know Luffy personally (Hancock, Koby, and Helmeppo) are surprised to find out that Luffy and Ace are not actually related. Garp, meanwhile, continues to think of the past, when he met with Roger in his cell before his execution. Roger explained that he was going to have a son but would not live long enough to see him and personally requested Garp to take care of him, knowing what would happen if either Rouge or Ace were found by the World Government. Garp seemed hesitant at first, but Roger was confident that Garp would honor his final request.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
