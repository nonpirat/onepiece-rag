{"content": "Meanwhile, Fukaboshi has managed to save Luffy from Hody's wraith despite his wounds. Hody however, uncovers a blade fin called Kirisame and puts it on his back. He darts after the two and they barely manage to dodge him, seeing Hody cut up a rock and a fish that was swimming by it. Luffy orders Fukaboshi to get him to the deck of the ship so he can fight easier as he wishes to keep his promise of protecting Shirahoshi. Hearing this, Fukaboshi remembers his promise he made with his mother to do the same. He tells Luffy this as well as apologizes for doubting him. Hody, overhearing this however, swims to the deck of the ship. He lands on Noah as Decken greets him, asking if he has killed Neptune and that he is using the ship to torment Shirahoshi, asking if it was a good plan. Hody responds by stabbing Decken with his trident, then ask Decken what would happen to the ship if he were to die.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
