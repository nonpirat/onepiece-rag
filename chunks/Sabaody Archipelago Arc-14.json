{"content": "Luffy tries to rescue Sanji and Zoro also tries to go in Luffy's place - however, Hatchan says that he's faster underwater and he will go. Duval then states that Flying Fish are the fastest creatures underwater and it is futile to try to chase them. Suddenly, Camie jumps into the sea to rescue Sanji, and Pappag remarks that Duval is wrong; he agrees that the fish are fast but that there is nothing faster in the oceans than a mermaid. Luffy is amazed at this revelation, and Pappag says that if she keeps her guard up, Camie is uncatchable.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
