{"content": "Before Akainu can strike Koby, out of nowhere, Shanks interferes, blocking Akainu's magma fist with his sword. He tells Koby that his few seconds of courage, for which he was willing to throw away his life, have changed the fate of the world. Law takes this opportunity to hurry up and escape. Kizaru is about to attack again when he is stopped by Benn Beckman, who threatens to shoot Kizaru if he \"moves a muscle.\" Shanks picks up his straw hat that Luffy had dropped and says that he has arrived to put an end to the war.\n\nThe Marines loudly exclaim at the arrival of the Red Hair Pirates, as they wonder how Shanks' recent encounter with Kaidou the day before ended so quickly and how he was able to arrive at Marineford so quickly. Shanks then calls Buggy to give Luffy his Straw hat, and in return, Shanks will give him a treasure map. Buggy quickly complies and heads towards Trafalgar Law's submarine, giving Law the straw hat.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
