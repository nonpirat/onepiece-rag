{"content": "Big Mom took the Vinsmoke Family save Sanji to another part of her library, where she kept a large variety of rare species. Judge noted that he had not seen any giants in Totto Land, and Big Mom was briefly angered, but then said that he must have just missed them. Big Mom then went to contact Luffy and Nami, and Lola's Vivre Card. Big Mom revealed that she wished to kill Lola for ruining a political marriage that could have let her become the Pirate King. However, Luffy was unfazed by Big Mom and challenged her, arousing her wrath. After the call, Pudding then came to the library and entered Luffy and Nami's cell. She told them that she would not be marrying Sanji, revealing to them in secret that she would murder him during the wedding. As she said this, she revealed a third eye on her forehead, and she also revealed that Big Mom would also renege on her agreement to spare the rest of the Sanji Retrieval Team. This left Luffy and Nami completely aghast, although they were unable to do anything.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Whole Cake Island Arc.txt", "title": "Whole Cake Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 825 to 902"}}
