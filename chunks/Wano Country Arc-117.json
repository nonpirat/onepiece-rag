{"content": "At the rear entrance of Kaidou's castle, the Scabbards sans Kin'emon and Denjiro confronted Kanjuro, who had predicted their arrival there and brought with him an assortment of Kaidou's forces as well as drawn soldiers of his own. The Scabbards entered combat with Kanjuro's troops while Kikunojo dealt with Kanjuro. Meanwhile, Yamato explained his relationship with Kaidou and the explosive cuffs that were forced into him as a way to prevent him from leaving Onigashima. Luffy offered to remove the cuffs, but right when he was about to do so, they overheard Kaidou's announcement through a projection in the room below the attic. Kaidou explained his plans to wage war against the World Government by claiming the One Piece and the Ancient Weapons alongside Big Mom, who coincidentally entered the Live Stage with her army of yokai Homies and a captured Nami and Carrot.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
