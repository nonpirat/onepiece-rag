{"content": "Meanwhile, Chopper managed to find the room where Zoro and Sogeking are fighting. They tell Chopper that he must find one of the other CP9 members and get the number 2 key. Chopper ran off, hoping that Sanji will have the right key. In the dungeon, Kumadori has Nami trapped with his hair attacks, giving her no opportunity to use her Clima-Tact.\n\nFranky, low on cola and thus unable to use any special attacks, is forced to box with Fukurou. They compared the strength of their punches and find themselves evenly matched in strength and toughness. After three cups of tea, Sanji came to his senses and demanded Kalifa's key. She took advantage of his reluctance to hurt women and kicked him across the room.\n\nFinally, Luffy reached the bottom of the Judicial Tower, where he can see the Gates of Justice in front of him. The only problem is that between him and the Gates is a giant whirlpool.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Enies Lobby Arc.txt", "title": "Enies Lobby Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 375 to 430"}}
