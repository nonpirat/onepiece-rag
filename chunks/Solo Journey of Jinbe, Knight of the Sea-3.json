{"content": "The gigantic fish-man reveals that after getting beaten up by the Straw Hat crew and exiled from Fish-Man Island, he found the offerings the people left for the sea beasts and helped himself to them. Out of gratitude, Wadatsumi started picking up the undersea ruins and throwing them into the port town, believing that the houses rightfully belonged to the humans. Angry at Wadatsumi's actions, Jinbe gives him a good scolding for his carelessness. He then goes to the Sea Beasts, who reveal that they woke up to find their homes gone and relocated to the port town, causing them to assume that the humans stole their homes on purpose, which is why they started attacking their ships. Jinbe reveals to them what truly happened, and thus the Sea Beasts and Wadatsumi apologize to the townsfolk who were livid at them for what they've done. At the same time, the sea-kitten is reunited with its parent, and Jinbe is relieved that everything has been resolved.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Solo Journey of Jinbe, Knight of the Sea.txt", "title": "Solo Journey of Jinbe, Knight of the Sea", "Chapters": "Chapters 751 to 785"}}
