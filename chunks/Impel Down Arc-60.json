A flashback shows us that Iva was actually part of Dragon's Revolutionary Army. One day, he notices that no matter where Dragon was, he would face and stare off in the same direction, which Iva assumes is an animal instinct of missing his homeland. However, Dragon refuses to answer on if this was true or if he had any family left behind and the matter was quickly dropped. After this startling realization, Iva has Inazuma find out Ace's departure time, since if the Vivre Card is still pointing downward, it means Ace has not been moved yet.
