{"content": "Neptune then begs the Straw Hats to save Shirahoshi, claiming her to be his treasure. Hody chuckles at the events he sees before him. The Minster to the Right curses Hody for the chaos he caused in the Fish-Man District, asking if he has no shame as a former soldier in the Neptune Army. Hody rebuttals that he did not care about the position and only sought power and intelligence from it, having been inspired by Arlong's ambition. He had hoped to become \"Arlong's Right Arm\" when he had taken over the world, but the Straw Hats put an end to that. As he talks, Nami notices the Arlong's tattoo on his arm and becomes visibly shaken by his words. Hody then shows his strength by breaking a part of the palace wall without even taken the Energy Steroids. Water floods into the room and Hody uses water drops as an attack called Yabusame, forming the water drops into arrows and sending them at the tied-up palace guards, injuring them in the process.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
