{"content": "With the gate unlocked, Luffy's group sails into Marineford. Ivankov wonders if Dragon will come to help or not. Upon hearing this, Luffy reveals he and Ace are not related and reveals Ace is Gol D. Roger's son, much to the shock of everyone on board. Back at Marineford, the Marines wait in anticipation for Whitebeard to make the first move. Suddenly, he hits the air, cracking it like a mirror before it causes explosions, shocking the Marines. Luffy's ship draws closer, though he cannot see anything through the fog, while Ace begins to think back to his early days of piracy. Back then, he was a teenager and set off three years before Luffy, with both promising to meet each other again. Ace formed the Spade Pirates, and his actions soon gained the attention of the Marines (much to Garp's anger) as well as Whitebeard himself.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
