{"content": "Enraged, Marco pins Squard down, asking how he could do such a thing. Squard knocks him aside, saying that it was their fault that it happened. As Whitebeard's other subordinate crews continue to take attacks from the Pacifistas, Squard claims that he knew about Whitebeard's \"deal with the Marines.\" He also berates Whitebeard for not telling him that Ace was the son of Gol D. Roger, whom he deeply loathed for the massacre of his crew by Roger's hand. He also claims that Whitebeard sold out his subordinate crews, as his deal with Sengoku was that he, his crew, and Ace would be allowed to be set free as long as all of the other pirate captains died. He supports his claim by pointing out how the Pacifistas are only targeting the subordinate captains. He then states that although he was lucky to manage to get an attack in on Whitebeard, he was ready for his death as punishment.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
