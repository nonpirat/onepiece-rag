{"content": "Pica quickly regrew his arm and attacked again, but Luffy managed to ride Ucy onto his other arm, with Abdullah and Jeet having joined him, Zoro, and Law on the bull's back. Pica prepared to attack them, but Luffy shattered his head with a Gear 3 punch. Pica's real body then emerged in front of the bull riders, and he tried attacking them with a giant sword, but Luffy helped Ucy dodge it and Zoro confronted Pica, allowing the others to continue toward Doflamingo. Since Pica's stone body was no longer inhabited, the other gladiators went after Luffy, and as they drew closer to the palace, Law revealed to Luffy that he wanted to take down Doflamingo to avenge an important person to him called Corazon, who was Doflamingo's real brother but was killed by him 13 years ago.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
