{"content": "Meanwhile, Camie manages to rescue Sanji and has trapped the Fish Riders in their own steel net. As Camie reaches the surface, Nami asks if Sanji is alright, and Camie says that he is safe but bleeding from his nose (due to his usual perverseness). Duval is now furious that Sanji is still alive, but Luffy remarks that his henchmen are now all gone. This further infuriates Duval, and he unleashes the full rage of his bison Motobaro onto Luffy.\n\nBut, to everyone's surprise, Luffy, reminiscent of Shanks, somehow makes the bison drop his rider, trod a few feet away and then faint. The Straw Hats, including Luffy, are amazed and confused about how he did it, further angering Duval. However, at this point Sanji arrives back on the dock, and tells Luffy he will take care of the rest.\n\nJust as Duval is about to attack, Sanji performs the same face bashing techniques that he did on Wanze on the Sea Train.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
