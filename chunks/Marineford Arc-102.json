As the battlefield too is starting to get uneven, the Blackbeard Pirates get further away from each other. Blackbeard asks how he should begin using his new powers, answering himself in the same moment by saying he will sink Marineford to its core. However, he is attacked by the Sengoku himself, in his Buddha form. Sengoku looks down, telling himself that they can just rebuild their base. But he tells Blackbeard that Marineford is the center of the world, and he will not let him sink it. Blackbeard challenges him to protect it.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
