{"content": "Inside the Green Bit Forest, Robin and Usopp overheard an exchange between a group of Marines and an unseen people. The Marines refused to hand over their weapons and were stripped. Robin then caught one of the people with her hands, realizing they were most likely dwarves. She saw the dwarf she caught, Kabu, but then the other dwarves knocked her and Usopp out with tranquilizer gas. They were split up, and when Usopp woke up, he claimed to be a descendant of Mont Blanc Noland, a hero of the dwarves who had visited Green Bit 400 years ago. Robin woke up in the Tontatta Kingdom, stitched to the ground with Leo's Nui Nui no Mi power as the dwarves of the Tontatta Tribe searched her. She claimed to mean no harm, and the dwarves instantly believed her due to their gullibility. Leo introduced her to their king Gancho, but told Robin they would need to take her weapons. Since she had no weapons, the dwarves prepared to strip her, but they were stopped by Flapper, who revealed that Robin was Usopp's friend.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
