His escape was soon noticed, with the pirate inhabitants after him for his Cross Guild bounty. In the process of his escape, he freed several captured Marines and rushed off to act as a decoy so that they may escape. Three of Blackbeard's commanders, Shiryu, Avalo Pizarro and Vasco Shot (the latter two now wielding the Shima Shima no Mi and Gabu Gabu no Mi respectively) discussed how to go about capturing him while Sanjuan Wolf (who wields the Deka Deka no Mi) slept nearby.
