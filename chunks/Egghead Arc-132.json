{"content": "Vegapunk this mission was tough on Kizaru already so he did not want to drag it out, when suddenly Luffy reappeared, activating Gear 5 and using Gomu Gomu no Gigant to grab Kizaru with his hand, just as the sound of his heartbeat seemed to reached down to the Fabriophase, activating the Iron Giant in response to Luffy's transformation. Kizaru, who was still being held by Luffy, then got swung around by Luffy and eventually thrown away from the Control Tower. With this short moment, Atlas decided to go to the Fabriophase to manually overwrite the Pacifista's command and she was aided by Dr. Vegapunk in her attempt under the protest of Usopp, but Vegapunk contacted Franky, asking if Bonney was safe with Franky confirming but that she landed on the Fabriophase. Sanji then offered to join the two in their endeavor while Jinbe gathered luggage for Vegapunk.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
