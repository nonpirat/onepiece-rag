{"content": "Luckily, after falling through the trench, the Straw Hats find themselves still in one piece, with the Sunny lying on its side at the bottom of the ocean floor. They notice light emitting from somewhere and find that it's their long-sought destination, Fish-Man Island, an island wrapped in a gigantic bubble.\n\nBefore they can go to the island, a voice calls out to Surume, criticizing him for letting humans order him around. Surume becomes scared, lets go of the Sunny, and runs off. And with good reason, as the Sunny is surrounded by a gang of much larger Sea Kings. The voice belongs to a daggertooth piked conger fish-man named Hammond, a crewmember of the New Fish-Man Pirates. He says that he knows about the Straw Hat Pirates, the ones who crushed Arlong's ambition but also protected Hatchan and assaulted one of the World Nobles.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
