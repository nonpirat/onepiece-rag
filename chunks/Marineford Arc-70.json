{"content": "Whitebeard mentions that Luffy has heart but agrees that he is too reckless, though he has a soft spot for people like him. Whitebeard once again attacks all the Marines in his way before being stopped by Akainu. He engages the Admiral in a battle of sheer power. Jinbe decides to join in as well, deciding that he will die in the battle. All around the plaza, pirates and Marines continue to battle, with neither side backing down. Marco attempts to reach Ace but is knocked back by Garp, who proclaims that if any of them want to get past him, it will have to be over his dead body.\n\nWhitebeard tells his subordinate crews not to be intimidated by Garp, as he is just an old man. Akainu reminds Whitebeard that they are of the same generation before proceeding to fire a hound made of magma at Whitebeard. He deflects the attack and causes more damage to Marineford.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
