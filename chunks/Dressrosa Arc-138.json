{"content": "- Donquixote Doflamingo is revealed to not have actually stepped down as Warlord in the previous arc. He had instead blackmailed the World Nobles to create the fake news that he had done so. However, he would in fact lose this title towards the end of the arc.\n- The Donquixote Pirates are defeated by the Straw Hats, Law, and an alliance made up of pirates and other fighters that had taken part in the Corrida Colosseum match for the Mera Mera no Mi, as well as the Tontatta Tribe is established.\n- Doflamingo's reign on Dressrosa is brought to an end and he is arrested.\n\t- Doflamingo's SMILE Factory is destroyed, putting an end to Kaidou's SMILE production. Kaidou's crew hears this news, though Kaidou does not until the Zou Arc.\n\t- All of Doflamingo's other Underworld businesses are brought down as well, most notably his arms dealership. This causes some groups that purchased weapons from him to swear revenge on the Straw Hats and Law.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
