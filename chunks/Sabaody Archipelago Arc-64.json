{"content": "Back in Grove 12, the Straw Hats encounter yet another Kuma who fires a beam at Luffy though he manages to dodge it (as well as be amazed by it alongside Chopper). His crew then inform him of their encounter with Kuma on Thriller Bark before Franky fires a Coup de Vent on the Warlord of the Sea in retaliation for that attack, knocking him back. Realizing that Kuma is very strong, Luffy goes into Gear 2 while Sanji and Zoro prepare to attack as well though the latter realizes that this Kuma seems different from their previous encounter. Meanwhile, in Grove 49, the axe-wielding shadowed figure from before commenting Kizaru is late and that if he does not hurry there will not be anything left.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
