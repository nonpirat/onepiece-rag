Wapol was then thrust into the limelight for this invention, which he dubbed \"Wapometal.\" With this new metal, Wapol became rich enough to build massive toy shop, and then an entire factory, and even an entire conglomerate. He then ends up marrying a beautiful and apparently well-known woman by the name of Kinderella, otherwise known as \u201cMiss Universe\u201d. With Kinderella and Hakowan at his side, Wapol revels at the fact that he had become more rich and powerful than he ever was as a king.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wapol's Omnivorous Hurrah.txt", "title": "Wapol's Omnivorous Hurrah", "Chapters": "Chapters 236 to 262"}}
