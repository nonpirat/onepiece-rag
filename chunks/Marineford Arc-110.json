{"content": "Lucky Roux then asks Shanks if he is sure he does not want to see Luffy again, since it has been ten years since they last met, showing flashbacks of Shanks giving Luffy his straw hat. Shanks then answers, saying he would love to see Luffy again, but if he saw him now, that would violate their agreement. Akainu curses Shanks' name as Aokiji attempts to freeze the submarine over with Ice Age. Kizaru then decides to attack using Yasakani no Magatama, while the submarine attempts to dive to escape Kizaru's attack. Kizaru then decides that if the Heart Pirates, Luffy, and Jinbe survive the attack, the Marines should just let them go and say they got lucky. Worried, Boa Hancock comandeers a Marine ship and gives orders to chase the submarine, under the pretense that she intends to finish off Luffy herself.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
