{"content": "Oars Jr. surprisingly rises, having been awakened by the blast. As the Marines all aim at him, preparing to finish him off, a pillar of water flies through the sky, soaring over the gap in the wall and landing right in front of the execution platform. From the water emerges Luffy, wielding a mast from one of the ships in his hands. Standing right before Luffy, the Admirals all comment on his boldness. Luffy tries to strike the Admirals with the mast, but Aokiji freezes it. He then uses Gomu Gomu no Stamp Gatling, which shatters the frozen mast.\n\nWhitebeard notes how Luffy's recklessness is just like Ace's. He orders Oars Jr. to stay where he is and commands Jozu to prepare their trump card.\n\nAs the Admirals dodge the projectiles formed from the frozen mast, Luffy activates Gear 2, hoping to make a straight dash for Ace. However, Kizaru easily catches up to him and knocks him aside with a kick of light.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
