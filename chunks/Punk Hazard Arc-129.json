But he responds by firing a mobile version of the Gaon Cannon, the General Cannon, at the two. This manages to blow them away, but they recover albeit heavily wounded, in the process mentioning they were after Caesar who, Franky noticed for the first time, was on the tanker.

When questioned by Luffy if they were his friends, Law coldly states the two are his enemies.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
