{"content": "Just as Luffy's group is about to head in, some of the slime suddenly lands on the ship the G-5 Marines have acquired. Both sides are bewildered on what the slime is. The G-5 men try attacking it, but it starts emitting toxic gas and the slime pieces suddenly merge together, making it bigger. One of the Marines suggest pushing it into the water and stupidly tries to do so but get sucked into the slime. His fellow comrades pull him out with the Marine yelling he cannot feel his face. As some of the Marines try to tend to him, another Marine comes up with a flame thrower and tries to burn the slime. It seems to work at first, but the slime suddenly explodes, destroying the ship and all the men on it to the shock of everyone on shore.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
