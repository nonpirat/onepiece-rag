{"content": "\"Encore! Encore!\" the crowd yells at Brook's farewell concert. Unfortunately, the Marines and his former managers have flanked him. The Marines confirm him as \"Humming Brook,\" with a 33,000,000 bounty, and a member of the Straw Hat crew. Brook's fans are distressed by the news, while others silently ponder whether Brook should be granted leniency, even if he truly was a member of the Straw Hats, which were long thought to be dead and gone. His managers explained that, by telling them honestly that Brook would be retiring, it would be the end of the business exploit, hence inciting them to have Brook die with them. In fact, this incites Brook to call on his band and dancers to help him declare that the rumors were false. \"Straw Hat Luffy... Dead? Ridiculous! Tell This to the World. The Pirate Straw Hat Luffy is ALIVE!\" The Marines are held by the fans as Brook rocks the concert, ready to go to the New World.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Return to Sabaody Arc.txt", "title": "Return to Sabaody Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 598 to 602"}}
