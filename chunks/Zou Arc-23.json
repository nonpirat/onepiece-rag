{"content": "In the present, the Straw Hats continued riding to see Nekomamushi. Luffy was initially excited about the possibility of Sanji marrying, but was told that if he did, the Straw Hats would become subordinates of Big Mom. It was for this reason that led Brook to believe Sanji had cut himself off from the crew. However, Zoro reminded them that Sanji left of his own volition without apologizing, and that they had already angered Kaidou, making it unwise to directly challenge another Emperor. This led to an argument, and Luffy decided to go and ask Sanji himself, but was reminded that Big Mom is a powerful Emperor and they could not invade her domain without a strategy.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Zou Arc.txt", "title": "Zou Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 802 to 824"}}
