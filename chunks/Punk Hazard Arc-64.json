{"content": "Back at the main lab, Law has gotten inside to find only Monet by herself. He tells her he is thinking of departing and needs her ability to help with something, which she accepts. As they exit the room, Chopper, who was hidden in a bag, watches them go. Outside, Luffy begins his fight against Caesar by trying to use his Gomu Gomu no Bell move enhanced with Busoshoku Haki. Caesar dodges and tries to use poisonous smoke on Luffy, but Luffy is unaffected, due to his poison immunity he gained from his battle against Magellan. He hits Caesar knocking him to the ground. But as he tries to follow it up, Caesar uses a castanet to send out explosive gas. Luffy is caught in the blast and starts to fall to which Caesar calls for his slimes to grab him. They converge on Luffy which, along with Caesar's castanet, causes an even bigger explosion.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
