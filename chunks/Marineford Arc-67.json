{"content": "The pirates in the bay, attempting to make their way past the iron wall, all try to swim through the gateway made by Oars Jr. As the Marines prepare to fire upon the susceptible pirates, a coated ship suddenly emerges from beneath the sea, allowing most of those in the water to climb aboard. Whitebeard notes that he never said that all of his ships had surfaced. While the Marines are busy debating whether or not they should aim at Oars Jr. or the ship, Oars Jr. lifts the ship into the air and pulls it through the hole he created. As the pirates prepare to storm the stage, Oars takes cannon fire, causing him to collapse once more. Whitebeard then leaps into the plaza and, commanding his \"children\" to keep away, swings his naginata in a circle, knocking away all of the Marines in his path.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
