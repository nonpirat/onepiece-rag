{"content": "Wapol goes into the castle looking to eat more weaponry along the way running into Nami giving chase when he realizes she is a friend of Luffy, when he gets stuck in a stairwell he \"eats himself\" and emerges skinny before continuing the chase. Luffy finds Nami in time to stop Wapol from killing her, but Wapol escapes. Luffy pursues Wapol, but Wapol reaches a tower which supposedly holds a very powerful and giant cannon called Royal Drum Crown 7-Shot Bliking Cannon. Wapol attempts to shoot Luffy with it, however while it sat unused during his absence, Snow Birds made nests in it. As a result, Wapol's attack on Luffy fails. The king then tries to stop Luffy with the cannon he ate earlier, but Luffy dodges it and sends Wapol into the castle's ceiling with his bowgun attack.\n\nRealizing he is outmatched, Wapol frantically begs Luffy to spare him by offering him the position of second king. Luffy does not listen and sends Wapol flying to another island with Gomu Gomu no Bazooka.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Drum Island Arc.txt", "title": "Drum Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 130 to 154"}}
