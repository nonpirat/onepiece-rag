{"content": "Upon seeing the fatal blow Akainu inflicted upon Ace, every pirate rushes to attack the Admiral and stop him before he can finish off Ace or Luffy. However, Akainu's Logia intangibility keeps him from being injured in the bombardment, and, noticing that Ace still has some life in him, he moves in to attack him again. Jinbe cries that he will tolerate no more of this and rushes in to take the blow with his right arm. Akainu chastises him for his actions, commenting that as a former Warlord, Jinbe would know about the power he wields. The fish-man retorts that he would gladly pay with his life to delay him, since he fully intended to die anyway. Meanwhile, Mr. 3 is dragged over to Marco, who orders him to remove the Seastone handcuffs. Sengoku and some of the other Marines realize that Garp is acting strangely; Sengoku slams him into the ground, demanding to know his intentions. As they struggle, Garp warns the Fleet Admiral that he had better keep him held tightly down or else be sure that he will murder", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
