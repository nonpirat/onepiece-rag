Franky uses his Nipple Lights as a morse code, but the light turns out to belong to a giant angler fish. The fish tries to eat the ship, but is stopped by a giant humanoid creature, which is incorrectly identified as an Umibozu, a sea giant, by Usopp. The giant punches the angler fish, whose name is Ankoro, saying that it was not supposed to eat ships and that Captain Vander Decken would be mad at them.
