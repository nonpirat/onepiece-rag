{"content": "As morning broke, the Underworld Emperors who were invited to the wedding arrived on Whole Cake Island, with the conglomerate member Du Feld, the queen of the Pleasure District Stussy, and the reporter for the World Economic Journal Morgans among them. They went to the wedding venue at the top of the Whole Cake Chateau, where Bege stood guard. A man named Jigra attempted to get in, but was shot by Sweet Commander Charlotte Katakuri. Katakuri, whose Kenbunshoku Haki was so advanced it allowed him to see into the future, had foreseen that Jigra had been attempting to attack Big Mom. At 10:00 AM, Big Mom entered the venue, and the tea party festivities began. Big Mom was presented with presents from her Underworld guests, and revealed that she planned to open the Tamatebako that she received from Fish-Man Island as well. With everyone in the venue, Caesar remained outside while Bege took the Sanji Retrieval Team in to initiate their plan.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Whole Cake Island Arc.txt", "title": "Whole Cake Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 825 to 902"}}
