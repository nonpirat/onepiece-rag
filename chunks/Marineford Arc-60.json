{"content": "One of the Decalvan Brothers comments on how hard it must be for Squard to have been tricked and to be responsible for stabbing Whitebeard, causing Whitebeard's subordinate crews to scream that they'll never forgive the Marines. As Squard wallows in the grief of his own sins, Marco asks him if just crying will help set things right.\n\nLuffy, musing on how strong Whitebeard must be, continues to run head-long towards the execution platform. Ivankov notes that all of the Marines are retreating into the plaza. While Jinbe agrees that it is worrisome, he states that there is no time to think, as Whitebeard is on the move. John Giant then appears on the front line, ready to stop Whitebeard and his crew with his and Whitebeard's weapons.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
