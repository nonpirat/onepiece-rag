{"content": "Back at the palace, Usopp chastises Zoro for going too far after the group has defeated and chained up Neptune, his ministers, and the Ammo Knights. Usopp states that they plan to intimidate the guards and run off when they got the chance. Usopp is annoyed when Nami asks one of the guards the location of the Treasury and is further annoyed when Brook suggests singing. Neptune mentions that he is no longer a fighter and has grown too old to do so since his back gave out. The group wonders about Luffy and where he has gone. Zoro suggests that they grab the Sunny and flee, but Usopp says the coating bubble broke when they crashed into the island, so they can't. Nami also notices the Log Pose is going haywire and cannot lock on anything. One of the ministers mocks her for this, and when she asks why, he agrees to tell her only if she unties him.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
