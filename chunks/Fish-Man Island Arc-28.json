{"content": "This rule stems from the death of Fisher Tiger, who apparently died bleeding after a battle and could have been easily saved with a transfusion, but no humans were willing to help him. Hammond then commands Luffy to come with him before resorting to trying to capture him with a net. Luffy dodges it and hits Hammond and his lackeys with a Jet Pistol, knocking them out. The sea monster that Hammond brought with him tries to attack Luffy, but the Straw Hat captain uses Haki to subdue the beast. The beast calms down before it can even reach Luffy, which shocks Usopp. Camie appears unexpectedly on a gondola (owned by the princes), calling for Luffy and the others to board, and explains that there is a port in town with humans who may be able to assist them. Luffy's group does so, and they take off. Camie also mentions that it has been a while since humans have come down to Fish-Man Island. The Straw Hats are the first guests that they have had in a while. She also mentions that there are rumors of some big shadow", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
