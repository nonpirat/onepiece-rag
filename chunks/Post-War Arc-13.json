{"content": "Luffy's yelling attracts attention to the trio and they hide as the Bluejam Pirates arrive, led by a man named Porchemy. His subordinates reveal that it was they whom Ace had stolen the money from. At first, it seemed the three managed to hide before he spotted them, but Luffy somehow ended up near them and was captured. Porchemy threatens him but Luffy claims he does not know anything about the money, though his expression states\u00a0otherwise, and he accidentally gives away Ace's name. Porchemy then carries Luffy off, stating he will make him talk, as Ace and Sabo look on in horror.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
