{"content": "- Luffy cites his observation of Rokushiki this arc, specifically Soru, as a direct inspiration for Gear 2 during his fight with Blueno in Enies Lobby.\n- CP9 is revealed to have the authority to summon an island-destroying fleet of battleships, known as the Buster Call.\n- Nami introduced the Gates of Justice and the three main government facilities that it guards: Enies Lobby, Marine Headquarters, and Impel Down, foreshadowing the Summit War Saga.\n- Nami unveils the completed Perfect Clima-Tact, an upgraded model of the original Clima-Tact created by Usopp after he had mistakenly designed a joke weapon. This was his last work before he left the crew, fashioned by implanting Dials from Skypiea in her staff. Now that the Clima-Tact is a competent weapon instead of a comedic party favor, Nami begins to engage in more riveting and serious fights against her opponents.\n- Sanji using knives as a fighting method similar to swords will later be revealed to be related to his distant past.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Water 7 Arc.txt", "title": "Water 7 Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 322 to 374"}}
