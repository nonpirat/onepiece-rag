{"content": "Luffy manages to break through and continues after Ace on a rope bridge. Annoyed, Ace knocks him off into the chasm below. Ace returns to the mountain bandits and claims he does not know where Luffy is when asked, which Dadan roughly shrugs off as not being her responsibility. A week later, Luffy returns to the cabin, battered but alive. When asked what happened, Luffy claims to have been chased off a cliff by wolves. The next day, Ace heads off on his own again, and Luffy tags along behind him. Ace would venture out and Luffy would try to follow him, each time with Luffy ending up in one dangerous situation after another, which Ace would purposely lead Luffy into.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
