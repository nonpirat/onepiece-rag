Bonney, however, tackles Zoro into the ground before he can do so, putting up an act as if he was shot and killed. Charlos, at first thinking Zoro dodged, shrugs it off and buys it before he and his subordinates go on their way. Once gone, Bonney instantly chastises Zoro for his actions and almost bringing the Admirals on them. Zoro, however, is clueless to the whole situation while most of the Supernovas, who were watching and commenting on everything, are impressed by his strength and murderous intent. Zoro then picks up the doctor that was shot and goes to locate a hospital, much to the confusion of Bonney since after all he is a pirate.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
