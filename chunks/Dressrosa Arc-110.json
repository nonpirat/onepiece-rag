{"content": "Zoro decided to fly through the air and cut Pica up, and he ran to Elizabello to tell him to withhold his King Punch for now. He then came to Orlumbus, and asked him to throw him toward Pica like the Admiral had done earlier. Pica arrived at the King's Plateau, and Doldo was prepared to take his attack; Pica then brought his massive hand down on the Plateau. Orlumbus then threw Zoro at Pica, and Zoro successfully bisected Pica at the waist. Taking note of which piece of stone Pica inhabited, Zoro continued cutting his body up until Pica was forced to come out. Pica cladded his entire body in Haki and leaped at Zoro, but Zoro proved his Haki to be stronger as he cut Pica with Sanzen Sekai, defeating him. The remains of Pica's stone body fell toward the King's Plateau, but they were blown away by Elizabello's King Punch and placed out of harm's way by Fujitora.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
