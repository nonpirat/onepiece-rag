{"content": "Thunder Soldier remembered his past life as the legendary gladiator Kyros. As a boy, he was a violent criminal who grew up in the slums, but King Riku gave him the opportunity to fight in the Colosseum for his freedom. Kyros stayed in the Colosseum and won thousands of matches without being defeated, even taking down fighters who came from afar. However, he was depressed that he would forever be seen as a killer. After defeating Doldo himself in his 3,000th match, Doldo made Kyros commander of his army. As commander, Kyros saved the princess Scarlett, Viola's older sister, from a pirate crew. She fell in love with him afterwards, having her death staged so she could live with him. The two had Rebecca, but Kyros refused to touch her with his blood-stained hands. When Doflamingo took over Dressrosa, Kyros went to the royal palace to rescue King Riku, where Seastone chains were wrapped around his leg. He cut his leg off to attack Doflamingo, but was turned into a toy by Sugar. He managed to escape with Doldo,", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
