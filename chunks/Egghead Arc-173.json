{"content": "The crew made it to an island where they knew Kuma would be and went to look for him while they were being chased by the Marines. However, Kuma noticed them and teleported away, as he knew he could not see her. As the crew was at sea, they suggested they could take their time searching for Kuma, with Bonney saying that they could also look for Nika. At this time, Luffy was given his first bounty, reaching those such as Jinbe and Kuma. This would also make Dragon plan on heading to Loguetown. Bonney also made herself look grown up and wanted to make a name for herself as a pirate, hopeful it would get Kuma's attention.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
