{"content": "Kuma fires a laser blast from his mouth, sending Luffy and Ivankov flying. Ivankov asks Kuma what happened to his body, while Luffy remembers that Kuma had stated before that they would \"never meet again.\" Kuma suddenly appears in the middle of Ivankov's Newkama army and launches a pressure cannon through a line of Okamas. Refusing to take any more of Kuma's actions, Ivankov spins his head around with Face Spectrum to make a mirage of dozens of faces and launches Death Wink from all of them with Galaxy Wink. Ivankov then kicks Kuma and sends him flying, shouting that he would not let Kuma get away with hurting his followers. He then states that as no one who ever saw his face could ever forget it, if Kuma somehow forgot his fear of Ivankov, then the Okama would just have to pound it back into his body. Preparing to fight Kuma, Ivankov sends his army to support Luffy as he heads for the gallows. At the same time, Buggy tells his army of escapees not to fall behind, while Mr. 3 asks Buggy if he is serious", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
