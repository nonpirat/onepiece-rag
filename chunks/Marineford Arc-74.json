{"content": "Again, the Marine guards prepare to execute Ace. Luffy charges forward, followed by Ivankov, who remind Luffy that his Tension Hormones make his body believe he is healed while his wounds still need healing. As they fight their way forward, Luffy sees Koby ahead of him. Koby tells himself he has to fight Luffy or else he will never change. He charges at Luffy using Soru, but Luffy counters with a Gomu Gomu no Bullet, knocking Koby out. Suddenly, however, he is attacked by more Pacifistas, who prepare to fire beams from their mouths. Hancock suddenly steps in, whom the Pacifistas recognize as an ally and stand down, allowing Luffy and Ivankov to pass. When the Pacifistas order Hancock to step aside, she attacks one, saying she does not want the likes of him to say her name.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
