{"content": "Whitebeard continues to rampage and keep the Marines at bay, and the frozen Jozu is carried aboard the ship by his fellow crewmates. Ivankov tells Luffy it is time to go. The Straw Hat tries to get Ace to escape with him and Ace acknowledges that escaping is necessary. However, before he does, he bows to Whitebeard in the midst of the chaos. Seeing this, Whitebeard asks if he was a good father, to which Ace tearfully answers, \"Of course.\" Whitebeard laughs heartily at the response. The rest of the pirates prepare to escape, but suddenly Akainu attacks them with a huge molten fist. He mocks Whitebeard's crew as \"cowards\" for grabbing Ace and running away and claims Whitebeard is nothing but a failure from a bygone era.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
