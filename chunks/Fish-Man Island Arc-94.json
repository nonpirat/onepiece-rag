A brief flashback shows Tiger himself going to Neptune and telling what he seen in the surface world, shocking both the king and queen. Queen Otohime instantly cried upon hearing the atrocities the humans were doing to fish-men. After the news of Tiger's stunt, Neptune doubted that they can attend a council meeting with the island in such an uproar.
