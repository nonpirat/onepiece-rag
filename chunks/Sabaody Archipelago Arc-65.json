{"content": "Back at Grove 12, Franky, Usopp and Brook just barely avoid a blast from the Kuma they are facing. As Kuma goes to fire again, Luffy, Sanji, and Zoro rush him and perform a combo attack, managing to knock him down. Luffy then questions on if the Kuma they're fighting is a fake, to which Sanji and Zoro question as well due to this Kuma's attack style not fitting the one that they faced before. The three then come to the conclusion that there's more than one Kuma running around.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
