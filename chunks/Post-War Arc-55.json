{"content": "On Kuraigana Island, which we find out is the home of Mihawk, who has returned and is reading the newspaper about Moria's supposed death, which causes Perona to cry, although Mihawk doubts the credibility of the article. Meanwhile, Zoro is fighting against humandrills that somehow know swordplay and is having a tough time reaching the ocean. Mihawk appears and notices the boat he gave him to get off the island has been trashed. When asked why he is in such a rush, Zoro reveals he found out about the battle at Marineford as well. However, Mihawk tells him that 7 years ago, war broke out over the island and the humandrills learned their skills from the people that fought it and grew strong over the years. Mihawk offers Zoro a place to rest at his castle, but Zoro roughly refuses his offer and continues to try to leave the island.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
