{"content": "Meanwhile, Zoro, Sanji and Brook have awakened and continue with their search for the samurai, though Zoro and Brook have gotten bumps on their heads and the three argue on what attacked them. The story flashes back to an hour earlier when they had begun their search when they spotted giant footprints in the ground thinking they belong to a snowman. They followed the trail leading them to a cliff. However, it was an ambush by the Yeti Cool Brothers who had shot them with gas that caused them to become drunk. The brothers then shot the cliff causing the three to plunge to a lower cliff filled with icicle spikes. Zoro managed to remain awake long enough to cut the cliff in half for them to fall safely before passing out in midair. When Caesar's guards came to collect the bodies, Sanji managed to awaken first and defeat their captives despite being in Nami's body. He then kicked Zoro and Brook awake to continue their search.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
