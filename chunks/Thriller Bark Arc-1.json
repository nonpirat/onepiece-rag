{"content": "When Zoro wakes up, he notices a barrel floating in the ocean and alerts the rest of the crew over the built-in speaker system. When they fish the barrel out of the sea, they notice that it is an offering to the sea god. After a short discussion, they open the barrel, but instead of finding food and sake, a red light shoots out of the barrel and into the sky. Fearing that someone may spot them and knowing\u00a0that a big storm is heading in their direction, Nami orders the crew to head southwest. Unfortunately, the headwind catches them, prompting Franky to unveil the Soldier Dock Channel 0; a set of paddle wheels. Using the paddle wheels, they avoid the storm and finally enter the Florian Triangle.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Thriller Bark Arc.txt", "title": "Thriller Bark Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 442 to 489"}}
