{"content": "At Caesar's lab, Monet is talking to Vergo, and says he must have missed a spot when wiping his face, since there is an almost whole hamburger patty on his cheek. Luffy, Franky, Robin, Law, Smoker, and Tashigi are all captured in a cage, and Robin asks if it feels nostalgic, because Luffy and Smoker were locked up together in Arabasta as well. Vergo reveals himself to be not only a vice admiral, but also an underling of Joker. Luffy then asks Law who Joker is, and Law reveals him to be Donquixote Doflamingo, and also states he used to be an underling of him.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
