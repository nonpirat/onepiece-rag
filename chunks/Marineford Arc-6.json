{"content": "In the present, Sengoku continues by mentioning that two years ago, Ace took to the sea as the captain of the Spade Pirates. His strength and speed caused the World Government to realize that Roger's bloodline had not ended. However, Whitebeard had noticed it too, and he recruited Ace before the World Government could reach him. Sengoku, however, notes that Whitebeard did so to make Ace into the next Pirate King. Ace heavily denies it, but Sengoku rebuffs him, ending his speech by saying that if they left Ace that way, he would have surely stood above all other pirates, which is why this execution is so important, even if it meant going to war with Whitebeard.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
