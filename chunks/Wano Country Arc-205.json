{"content": "As Nami, Usopp and Tama descended the stairs between the second and first floor with their tamed Headliner escorts, they come across Kin'emon's disembodied legs, desperately running around looking for comrades. As it turned out, after Law separated Kin'emon with his ability back in Punk Hazard, his torso was never properly attached to his lower body, thus allowing him to survive when Kaidou impaled him. Taking advantage of this, he sent his legs out to find help. The Straw Hats caught the legs, and after indicating themselves as allies by drawing the mark of the rebellion, Kin'emon communicated with them (using farts) the dire condition he and Kiku were in. Using Hamlet as a ride, Usopp volunteered to go help them.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
