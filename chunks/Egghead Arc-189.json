{"content": "At the Fabriophase, Luffy asked why Bonney was crying, and she said that he was Nika, the one she had been looking for, though Luffy did not know what she was talking about. He also asked about the punch she tried using against Saturn, and she said she was trying to use a rubber punch similar to him and asked him to show her how to do it by attacking Saturn. Luffy agreed, using Gomu Gomu no Dawn Gatling against Saturn and sending him flying back. Afterwards, Bonney tried getting Vegapunk to come with them, but he said that if he were to move, he would die. Kizaru appeared and tried targeting Vegapunk, but his laser beam was blocked by Sanji's kick, shocking both him and Franky. Bonney, Atlas, Franky, and Kuma proceeded to escape to the northeast coast while Sanji and Luffy dealt with Kizaru and Saturn. Kizaru considered the situation a pain and said that at least he would take back their heads.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
