{"content": "Luffy is unable to hurt Lucci, who hit him with a rapid-fire Shigan. Franky comes to Luffy's aid by trying to hit Lucci with the same move he used against Fukurou. Franky's move is unsuccessful against Lucci's much-stronger Tekkai, and Lucci prepared to strike Franky. Luffy used his Gear 2 ability and knocked Lucci away. Franky was astonished by Luffy's strength and power, and encouraged him to defeat Lucci. Luffy manages to keep the now transformed Lucci at bay and allowed Franky to leave the room to chase after Spandam and Robin.\n\nOn the bridge, Spandam dragged Robin by a rope, gloating that no one will ever reach her because he set up landmines behind them. He then explained that his father, Spandine, was the one who led the destruction of Ohara, which infuriated Robin. There is an explosion as Franky triggered the landmines and is blown into the water, and Spandam laughed that no one will save Robin.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Enies Lobby Arc.txt", "title": "Enies Lobby Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 375 to 430"}}
