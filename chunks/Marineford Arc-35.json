{"content": "Much to the shock of the Marines, as well as Luffy's and Whitebeard's subordinate crews, Sengoku reveals that Luffy's father is none other than the Revolutionary, Dragon. While Moria, Buggy, and\u00a0Galdino seem shocked at the news, Mihawk says that at that point, that fact was hardly surprising. Hancock feels that she loves him even if his father was the devil. Kuma continues to remain expressionless, while Jinbe and Doflamingo realize that Luffy's actions finally make sense. Smoker is now able to understand why the revolutionary saved Luffy in Loguetown.\n\nLuffy remains unfazed by the fact that his lineage was revealed to everyone at Marineford, as well as the whole world, due to the reporters watching on. He smashes his way through more of the Marines with Gear 3, claiming that he does not care if Ace objects, and that he would rescue Ace even if it killed him. Whitebeard, in even more awe than before, tells Marco that he will not forgive him if he lets Luffy die.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
