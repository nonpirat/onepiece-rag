{"content": "Enel's Great Space Operations, Chapters 428 to 474, Volumes 44 to 49.\n\n\nLong Summary\n\n\nThe story begins with Enel riding his Ark, Maxim to the moon, which he believes to be the \"Fairy Vearth\" of legend. After landing, he takes in the sights and explores his new home.\n\nWhile exploring, he then sees something possibly alive within a crater and investigates, finding an unconscious creature wearing a soldier's uniform laying on the ground. Without a second thought, Enel cruelly attacks the poor thing with a lightning strike. However, the creature turns out to be a mechanical life form, and instead of harming it, the electricity recharges it back to full health, much to Enel's disappointment. The robot shows its gratitude with a salute, identifying itself as First Lieutenant Spacey. Spacey then expresses his regret for abandoning his position when fighting the enemy and goes back to the area where the battle took place, with Enel choosing to follow out of curiosity.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Enel's Great Space Operations.txt", "title": "Enel's Great Space Operations", "Chapters": "Chapters 428 to 474"}}
