{"content": "Spandam ordered the Marines to take back Robin, but the Marines stopped as they see the Buster Call approaching. The Buster Call is now upon Enies Lobby and is about to destroy everything. The fleet appears along with the five Vice Admirals.\n\nThe Buster Call Marines explain that they can destroy everything but the bridge on Enies Lobby, because Robin is standing there, although Spandam thinks it is because of his presence. It is revealed that during the last Buster Call, everything on Ohara was destroyed except for the ground where Spandine was standing.\n\nThe Franky Family continued to rush to the Gates of Justice; meanwhile, Sogeking (blown off from the attack on the tower) falls to where Sanji and Zoro are located. They tried to get Sogeking to leave, but he is slowed by injuries. He tried to explain the properties of Kabuto, but is cut off by Sanji. Nami, Chopper, Kokoro, Chimney, and Gonbe are under the room where Lucci and Luffy are fighting, which is also filling up with water.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Enies Lobby Arc.txt", "title": "Enies Lobby Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 375 to 430"}}
