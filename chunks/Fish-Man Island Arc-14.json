{"content": "Luffy goes into Gear 3 and equips a Busoshoku Haki, hardening his arm. However, as he is using it in the ocean, he is weakening as a result. The Kraken tries to grab him, but Sanji dashes through the water using Blue Walk toward it outside his bubble. He then hits the Kraken with Diable Jambe: Bien Cuit: Grill Shot. Zoro goes in next and uses Santoryu Ogi: Rokudo no Tsuji to cut off one of the Kraken's tentacles into six pieces. Luffy complains to the two that they are going to take off all its legs before hitting the Kraken with Gomu Gomu no Elephant Gun. This beats the Kraken, though the group notices a large shark with a shirt on swimming around the Kraken. Before they can wonder what is going on, though, they are all swept up in the current of the Downward Plume and pulled further down. Franky, with Nami's navigation, manages to keep the ship from crashing, but the Monster Trio ends up separated from the ship.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
