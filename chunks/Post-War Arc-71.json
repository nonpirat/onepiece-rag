{"content": "On a burning island in the New World, the Blackbeard Pirates are drinking, eating, and relaxing on their raft, which, according to Teach, is breaking apart, so they are waiting to meet the Marines for a battleship in exchange for Jewelry Bonney, who has been taken hostage by them. Teach approaches her, teasing her and telling her that he will set her free if she becomes his woman, to which Bonney kicks him with her free legs. Van Augur informs his captain that the Marines do not seem willing to do the exchange, as Akainu is leading them. The Blackbeard Pirates flee in a hurry, leaving behind their chained prisoner. He tells her that he was concerned when she escaped the World Government, but that the problem has now been resolved. Bonney angrily cries out that she will never forgive them.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
