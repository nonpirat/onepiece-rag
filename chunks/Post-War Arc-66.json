{"content": "In the Agenda Chamber, Lieutenant Commander Brannew briefs the other officers on what has happened recently, and we finally find out what Luffy did that caused such a stir. He, Jinbe, and Rayleigh went back to Marineford and managed to steal a ship since the security of the island had been stretched thin since Whitebeard's death. They sailed a ring around the island, which was stated to be a ritual for a burial at sea. Luffy then made his way into the plaza to the Ox Bell at the western edge of the island and rang it 16 times. He then threw a bouquet of flowers over the war wounds that remained on the ground and performed a silent prayer. This act was sent by photographers and journalists, which made it into the papers. Brannew then states that while this may seem like an act of respect to those that have fallen during the war, they should take the 16 bell rings as a declaration of war against the marines.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
