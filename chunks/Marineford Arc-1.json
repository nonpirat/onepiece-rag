{"content": "John Giant rallies his forces as a staggering one hundred thousand elite troops prepare for battle. Fifty Marine ships are stationed around the island, with cannons lining the coastline. The remaining Warlords of the Sea (Kuma, Moria, Doflamingo, Mihawk and Boa Hancock) are at the forefront of it all. Ace is located atop the execution stand at the rear of the island. Watching over him are the three Marine Admirals: Kizaru, Akainu, and Aokiji. With this, nearly every justice force imaginable is gathered, waiting for Whitebeard to make his move. On the Tarai Current, Luffy and the Impel Down escapees have finally reached the gate to Marineford. Jinbe tries to think of a way to penetrate it while Buggy rallies his followers.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
