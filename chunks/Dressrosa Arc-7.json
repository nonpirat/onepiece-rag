The blind man also departed from the Colosseum and was revealed to be the Marine Admiral Fujitora. Fujitora prepared to go to Green Bit, and also wanted to look into the amount of people on Dressrosa in case any innocents were injured. Inside the Colosseum, an undercover Marine listed the wanted pirates present to Vice Admiral Maynard, who was undercover as the contestant \"Capman.\" Maynard was then approached by Gambia of the Barto Club, and easily took down the pirate.
