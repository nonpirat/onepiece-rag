{"content": "Due to Luffy's actions against the Big Mom Pirates and reports of seven powerful pirate crews being under his command, he is now being called and considered as the \"Fifth Emperor.\" Shanks reacted positively, saying that it looked like he would be able to reunite with Luffy soon. However, the other Emperors reacted more negatively, with Kaidou angrily wondering why Luffy was in Big Mom's territory, Blackbeard saying that it was too soon for Luffy to be given the title, and Big Mom herself questioning Luffy's \"victory\" before swearing revenge against the Straw Hats.
