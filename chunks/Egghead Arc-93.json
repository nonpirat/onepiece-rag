{"content": "As they fled, Cobra requests Sabo tell Luffy and Vivi that they bear the name of D. Sabo is shocked to hear this remembering Ace likewise had the name as well back in the past when they were kids. Imu attacks again with his arrow and pierces both, somehow managing to bypass Sabo's Logia power and forcing him to drop Cobra. Cobra gets to his feet and stands in front of the monsters to give Sabo time to escape, while reciting the final lines from the letter, though it was partially drowned out by the roars of Imu and the Elders. Sabo can only watch helplessly and call out to Cobra as he is murdered in front of his eyes before being forced to flee.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
