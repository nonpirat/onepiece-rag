{"content": "Luffy is already headlong into Building A, knocking away the guards who come against him. He reaches the connecting passageway just as an alarm starts to go off. Law and Smoker arrive shortly after with Law realizing what Caesar is up to. At the lab entrance, the G-5 Marines ignore Law's warning and try to arrest the Straw Hats. Brook, Zoro and Kin'emon attack them to get them out of the way. Usopp, Sanji and Nami (later joined by Robin who stayed with them on Luffy's orders) are still on Brownbeard who rushes past the marines. Brownbeard notes the dragon that was with them and ponders why they brought it along with Sanji explaining they had used it to escape the gas, but it does not seem to fly now as it is sedated. Nami, oddly enough, finds it rather cute.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
