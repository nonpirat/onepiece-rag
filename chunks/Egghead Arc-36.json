{"content": "Back on Egghead, in the Scrap Heap, Luffy questioned why Vegapunk wanted to leave, to which he explained how he wished to create endless, free energy for all mankind, though this did not impress the Straw Hat captain. When Jinbe stated that a lack of resources to create energy is one of the main causes of war, Vegapunk enthusiastically expanded on that, stating how energy was everywhere and that he wished to convert it into a form that can be seen and harnessed, though Luffy was still unimpressed. The scientist then revealed that his research into this led him to investigate the \"ancient energy\" which was the power source of the Iron Giant; both this and Professor Clover's death ultimately motivated him to further Clover's initial research into the Void Century. Their conversation is then interrupted by an explosion caused by CP0 landing on the island, prompting Vegapunk to wrap things up by stating that the Government has caught wind of his actions and now they want to get rid of him.
