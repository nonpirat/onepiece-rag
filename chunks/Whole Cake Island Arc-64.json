{"content": "On Whole Cake Island, Mont-d'Or received a report from Custard that the Fire Tank Pirates had escaped. Meanwhile, the Vinsmokes defeated the 10,000-strong army of Big Mom Pirates sent to take them down, and Niji impersonated one of them to trick Mont-d'Or into thinking that the Big Mom Pirates were victorious. The Big Mom Pirates were unable to track the locations of the Fire Tank and Straw Hat crews, however, as the Sun Pirates had stuck around Totto Land and Praline had distracted the Territorial Sea Slugs by singing. Near Mont-d'Or, Pekoms cried over Pedro's death. Hours later, Stussy and Morgans joined Mont-d'Or's group and revealed to him that the Tamatebako caused the explosion that tipped over the Chateau. They then wondered if the Straw Hats would escape from Totto Land, but Mont-d'Or assured them no such thing would happen.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Whole Cake Island Arc.txt", "title": "Whole Cake Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 825 to 902"}}
