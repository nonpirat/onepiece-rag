{"content": "Back at the palace, Hody, Decken, and their crews enter the palace which catches Neptune and the Minister of the Right unaware, who mentions that Hody was once a soldier in the Neptune Army. Likewise, Hody and Decken are surprised that the guards and Neptune were already defeated before they got there. The Minister of the Left accuses the Straw Hats of inviting them, but Usopp rebuffs his claim, saying that they (Straw Hats) would not even be in the palace if Neptune had not invited them and ask who the invading fish-men group are. Neptune quickly accuses Vander Decken IX for kidnapping Shirahoshi. Decken states otherwise and is just as surprised when he finds out that Shirahoshi is missing. Hody tells Decken that even if the Mermaid Princess is no longer in the palace, he still has the power to find her. Decken then heads outside, grabs a coral, touches it, and throws it. Seeing it going away from the palace, Decken hops on, promising that if Shirahoshi is with someone else, then she is better off dying in", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
