{"content": "As \"Luffy\" calls for more drinks, he notices the woman from before and invites her over. She politely refuses, which quickly gains the ire of the \"Straw Hats.\" It is actually the real Nami, who is then warned by the bartender to choose her words carefully, pointing out that it was a very bad idea to provoke the \"Straw Hats.\" Nami ignores them and proceeds to enjoy her drink. The Fake Nami tries to threaten her but a carnivorous plant suddenly appears from out of nowhere and chomps on her and the Fake Luffy, as well as the other fake Straw Hats. Nami finds that the culprit for this deed is none other than Usopp, whom she instantly hugs upon seeing. Nami and Usopp leave the bar as the Fake Straw Hats try to go after them, but are stopped when black bubbles suddenly appear, forming into a cloud, and shock them. Fake Luffy recovers and orders his group to search for and kill the two.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Return to Sabaody Arc.txt", "title": "Return to Sabaody Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 598 to 602"}}
