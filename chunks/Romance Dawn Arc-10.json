{"content": "Luffy and Koby then walked up to the Marine base, and they found Zoro tied to a crucifix in the parade ground behind the outer wall. Zoro asked Luffy to free him, when suddenly a young girl named Rika climbed over the wall to feed him rice balls. However, Morgan's son Helmeppo then came in and took the rice balls, but then spit them out and stomped them into the ground due to them being sweet. He pointed out to the upset Rika that helping Zoro was a crime and ordered one of the Marines accompanying him to throw her over the wall. The Marine did so reluctantly, and Luffy caught Rika. When Helmeppo's group had left, Luffy went into the parade ground to recruit Zoro. Zoro refused to become a pirate as he had his own agenda, revealing that Helmeppo had agreed to free him if he stayed here a month without food. However, he then asked Luffy to feed him the rice balls that Helmeppo had stomped into the ground; despite them being mixed with a large amount of dirt, he told Luffy to tell Rika they were delicious.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Romance Dawn Arc.txt", "title": "Romance Dawn Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1 to 7"}}
