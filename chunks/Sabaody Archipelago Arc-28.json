{"content": "Meanwhile in Grove 24, we meet another noble, Saint Charlos, who was left behind by Shalria and their father, which he blames on the pirate he was riding on like a horse by kicking him. Charlos then spots some doctors transporting a gravely injured man by stretcher and stops them. Charlos is insulted by their supposed lack of respect for him. He then spots the nurse with them and instantly claims her to be his wife. Both the nurse, named Marie, and one of the doctors, who incidentally is her fianc\u00e9e, object to this which Charlos responds by shooting the man with his pistol much to Marie's horror. Charlos then has his servant take Marie away as she pleads for someone to help her lover. Zoro just happens to walk by, ignorant of the rules about nobles. He catches the attention of Charlos who steps in his way.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
