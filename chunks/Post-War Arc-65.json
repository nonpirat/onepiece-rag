{"content": "In Marineford, the Marine Headquarters is slowly being rebuilt little by little since the war. Smoker meets with Aokiji and states his wish to be transferred to G-5, a Marine base in the New World. Aokiji warns him that the base is full of problems. But Smoker does not mind, making it obvious he hopes to run into Luffy once again. In the medical base of the island, a doctor checks on Koby and tells him he has gained Haki due to the shock of the war. Helmeppo is a little miffed that Koby managed to gain a level of strength, but Koby tells him he does not know what is going on.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
