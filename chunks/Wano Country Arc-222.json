{"content": "However, King did not plan to let up, delivering a burning kick at Zoro just as he retrieved the Sandai Kitetsu, then transforming into his hybrid form to send a Barizodon from above, just as the swordsman collected the Wado Ichimonji and was retrieving Enma. The attack ended up sending him into the basement, and actually gave Zoro time to connect the clues of his own weapon. He realized that the certain old man in his village, who was Kuina's grandfather and who taught him Sunacchi, was none other than Shimotsuki Kozaburo, who illegally left Wano, became a pirate and later established Zoro's hometown, Shimotsuki Village. He was also the blacksmith who forged Wado Ichimonji and Enma. Recalling the words of the blacksmith, Zoro realized that Enma was testing him and that he had to go all out with his Haki, even going so far as to release his Haoshoku Haki. When King inquired about if he intended to be a king, Zoro agreed as he recalled his promise to Luffy and Kuina to become the world's greatest swordsman.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
