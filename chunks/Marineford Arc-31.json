{"content": "As Whitebeard observes Luffy, he recognizes the straw hat as the one that Shanks used to wear. When he tells Luffy that he had seen the hat with \"Red Hair,\" Luffy says that Shanks had let him borrow it. Whitebeard remembers the story that Shanks had told him about why his arm had gone missing: that he had placed it on \"a bet on the New Age.\" When asked if Luffy would still rescue his brother, even knowing the odds against him, Luffy not only emphatically responds that he will, but also that he, not Whitebeard, would be the Pirate King. This shocks all of the pirates and many Marines. Admiring Luffy's tenacity, Whitebeard merely tells Luffy to stay out of his way; Luffy states that he is going to rescue Ace on his own. Kizaru asks Sengoku if he can kill the intruders, which Sengoku allows.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
