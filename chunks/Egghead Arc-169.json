{"content": "At Lab 08, construction had been completed and Vegapunk had his head removed with the last step left to lift the lab and brain above. Stussy was also there and noticed Kuma was going to have his free will removed and wondered if it was worse that she had free will as a clone or that a true person like Kuma had none, but Vegapunk said she was also a real person. Kuma asked what would happen to him once he had his free will removed, where Vegapunk answered that he would obey every order from above and lose his memories and personality. Vegapunk also ensured Kuma would maintain some free will until the procedure finished, which would be in one more year. Hearing this, Kuma chose to write letters to Bonney with as much thought as possible beforehand.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
