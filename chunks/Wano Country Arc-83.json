{"content": "41 years ago, in a brimming and flourishing Wano, the former Shogun Kozuki Sukiyaki prepared to disown his 18-year-old son Kozuki Oden due to his outrageous actions he had committed during his life. Meanwhile, Oden, who had returned from one of his failed attempts to go to sea, was enraging some citizens by cooking a pot of oden over a man's cremated remains. A young Kin'emon stole a valuable white boar from a gang and fled to the Flower Capital. Denjiro, however, told him that the wrath of his parents, known as the Mountain God, would await those who would not return it. Just as the Mountain God attacked the capital, Oden overheard their conversation and told them to give him the boar.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
