In the underground port, the dwarves celebrated Usopp's actions, and in the palace, Thunder Soldier transformed back into Kyros. In the Colosseum as chaos erupted in the audience, Rebecca remembered that she had a father as Sabo decided to end the match, using Ryusoken to shatter the arena. He then leaped up to the fish carrying the Mera Mera no Mi and ate the fruit, before grabbing Rebecca and using Hiken to punch through the bottom of the Colosseum. Hajrudin grabbed Usopp and held him up before the other freed toys, who rejoiced in their savior as the ceiling gave in and the Colosseum fighters fell in.

They revealed that they had come to find and stop Doflamingo's Underworld weapons trade", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
