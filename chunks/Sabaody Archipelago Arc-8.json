{"content": "Meanwhile the Flying Fish Riders begin to bombard the ship, leaving Sanji to deflect all of the bombs being dropped. Luffy manages to pilot one of the fish, but the attack leader orders the entire crew to dive underwater including Luffy, which renders him helpless. Chopper and Brook try to save him only to realize that they cannot swim as well. This infuriates both Nami and Franky who rescue them while complaining about extra work that they caused. The Macro Pirates see an opportunity and try to capture Camie, only for them to find that Zoro has freed Hatchan from his cage while they were not looking. Hatchan defeats them quickly by uppercutting them into the air.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
