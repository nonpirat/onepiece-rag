{"content": "Just then, Nami calls out to Luffy. She and Camie have arrived. Camie is surprised to see him with Shirahoshi. Luffy asks Nami if the banquet had started yet while Sanji is overjoyed to see her. With Sanji acting normally, Chopper pronounces that Sanji fully cured (although whether it is due to the okama blood transfusion, or his building up a tolerance to beauty, is left unknown). Nami tells them that Hody Jones is now on the loose. Jinbe is astounded that the Ryugu Palace could fall into such a crisis. Luffy asks what happened to the rest of the crew. Nami tells him that she does not know as she was planning to go back after she found Luffy and Jinbe.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
