{"content": "The day of the Celestial Dragon's arrival comes, and the Goa Kingdom prepares for the event. However, the kingdom spots a fishing ship out in the ocean with a child sailing it, and the residents panic, worried that it will ruin the ceremony. It is revealed to be Sabo at the helm who prepares to sail off from the kingdom. The kingdom's residents try to get Sabo to turn back, but he ignores them, unaware that one of Dadan's crew, Dogra, is in the crowd who instantly recognizes him. Sabo, meanwhile, comments that his greatest fear is getting caught up in the country and becoming a different person, and he refuses to turn around.\n\nAt that instance, the Government ship carrying the Celestial Dragon arrives. Seeing it, Sabo tries to move out of its path while those on board spot him. The crowd at the kingdom cheers as they arrive, and even Sabo marvels at how big the ship is. However, the Celestial Dragon onboard pulls out a hand-held cannon and fires on Sabo's ship, setting it ablaze.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
