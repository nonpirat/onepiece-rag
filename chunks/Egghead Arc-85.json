{"content": "On Momoiro Island, a few of the Revolutionaries (Ushiano, Ahiru, Gambo, and Jiron) spot a ship coming to the island which is revealed to be Sabo who survived the destruction of Lulusia Kingdom due to already being on a ship along with a few others who wanted to join the Revolutionaries and was calling while sailing away before Imu destroyed the island. He refrained from calling again after fearing the Marines were still listening in on his transmission, though he had sent a coded signal to indicate he was okay. Sabo went to meet with Ivankov and Dragon who discuss Kuma for a bit before going into what he saw at Mary Geoise.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
