{"content": "Back at the Ryugu Palace, Hody is informed that a mermaid (Camie) and a pirate girl (Nami) managed to escape but Hody tells his subordinates to ignore them. Nami, breathing with an air bubble around her head, is seen riding on Camie's back. Nami asks Camie to take her to Jinbe after assuring the mermaid that the others will be alright. Camie complies and the two head for the Sea Forest. Back inside the palace, Neptune and the others have been freed. The guards wish to attack Hody but Neptune stops them, ordering them to let Hody have the palace while they regroup for a counterattack. Usopp worries about Zoro fighting underwater and goes down to check on him. Much to his and Hody crew's surprise, Zoro manages to deal a viciously brutal slash to Hody, striking fear into the shocked fish-man's heart.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
