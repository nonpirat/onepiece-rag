{"content": "Nami is nearly killed by Kumadori before Chopper attacked him to rescue her, and she escaped having stolen Kumadori's key. Sanji suddenly fell from an upper story, his body terribly wounded and deformed by some unknown power into a doll-like figure. He explained his plight to Nami, who gently chastised him for his foolishness before advancing to face Kalifa herself.\n\nAt the Gates of Justice, Luffy nearly drowned trying to cross the ocean by himself, but is rescued by Gonbe and Chimney, who led him to a secret passage that Spandam had used earlier. It led to the lower areas of the tower, and eventually to an immovable steel door. Luffy broke through it with his new Gear 3. The attack was not shown, but afterwards his body is briefly shrunk to child-size.\n\nLuffy returned to normal as he pursued Lucci and Spandam. Lucci informed his commander that they are being followed, and Spandam ordered him to wait behind to hold off any pursuit while he takes Robin to the Gates of Justice.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Enies Lobby Arc.txt", "title": "Enies Lobby Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 375 to 430"}}
