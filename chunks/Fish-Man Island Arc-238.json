{"content": "The Minister of the Right later meets up with Neptune, frantically explaining they needed to retrieve the Tamatebako from the Straw Hats as he had rigged it with a bomb after Hody had managed to open it 10 years ago. Neptune just tells him to explain the situation and ask them to return the box when they return. At that instant Luffy, Zoro and Sanji make it back but much to the group's shock find that he gave all the treasure to Pekoms and Tamago plus decided to pick a fight with Big Mom. Jinbe realizes he will really have to leave before things get bad while Neptune worries that if Big Mom finds the Tamatebako and opens it, it will seem like a declaration of war from Luffy. Nami however is more furious that they gave the rest of the treasure away, beating the Monster Trio senseless over it.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
