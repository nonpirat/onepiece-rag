{"content": "This strikes a chord with Ace, who turns to face him. He demands that Akainu take back what he said. The Pirate Captains and Luffy yell at Ace not to stop. Akainu continues to insult Whitebeard, claiming that since Whitebeard never defeated Roger nor became the Pirate King; he is a failure. The rest of the pirates urge Ace not to get provoked by the Admiral, but Akainu's continuing mockery eventually sets off Ace's temper. He attacks Akainu in fury, proclaiming that \"The name of this era is called 'Whitebeard'!\" However, he is badly burned on his left hand and knocked back, as Akainu's power is that of magma, and even though both he and Ace use Logia fire types, magma can burn anything, even fire.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
