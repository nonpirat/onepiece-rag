{"content": "Topside of the prison, the Marines have mobilized and prepare to enter Impel Down to capture Luffy. Before they can enter, they are stopped by the Chief Guard Sadi who implores them to stay outside to fortify the entrance since they do not have any knowledge of the structure of the prison. She reminds them that the pride of Impel Down is at stake so she and the staff inside will handle it. Sadi proceeds to raise the drawbridges of the prison keeping anyone from getting in or out. All the while, a giant koala peeping out from the prison's entrance gets the attention of the Marines.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
