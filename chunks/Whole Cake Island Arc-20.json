{"content": "Sanji remembered growing up in the Germa Kingdom, where his father Judge had him and his siblings train to unlock special superhuman modifications. However, Sanji constantly fell behind in all the exercises, and was brutally bullied by his brothers as a result. Sanji's compassionate activities such as cooking were put a stop to, and although Sanji's mother, Sora, encouraged these activities, she eventually died. After finding out that Sanji appeared to be a normal human without a trace of modifications in his body, the judge had Sanji locked away in a dungeon and had his death faked. Although he had to wear an iron mask, Sanji was fed in his cell and was able to study, but was eventually found by his brothers who started bullying him again. Eventually, Reiju told Sanji that the Germa Kingdom was heading to the East Blue, and that this would be his best chance to escape. When Germa came to the East Blue and invaded the island Cozia, Reiju freed Sanji and told him to head to freedom on a nearby ship.
