{"content": "Meanwhile, on the Sabaody Archipelago, an announcement is made to evacuate to the north side of the Archipelago to avoid tsunamis. In the midst of the war, Koby is crying, and Helmeppo asks him why. Koby simply answers that the \"voices\" in his head are disappearing one by one. He notices how the Marines are continuing to attack, even after completing their original goal of executing Ace. While he is thinking this, a nearby Marine is injured. Another Marine goes to his side to help him only to be told off by Akainu, saying they do not have time to treat the injured, much to the shock of Tashigi and Smoker. Doberman commands the Marines to beat every last pirate down; Akainu once more states that they cannot allow the \"evil known as pirates\" to exist.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
