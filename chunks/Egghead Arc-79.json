{"content": "Kujaku and Grus then cornered the pirates into a town square with his clay golems and her whip powers moving the buildings to create an enclosure. With the setup complete, Tashigi and Helmeppo yell to Garp that they are ready and have his Marine ship shoot into the air (similar to Franky's Coup de Burst) toward the square. Garp made himself known to the pirates, who were unable to run due to the buildings blocking their path, stating their mistake in capturing his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 before striking the lot with Galaxy Impact which proceeded to demolish the area. Grus used his clay power to cushion the landing of Garp's ship as Garp goes to confront the pirates, lamenting his strength not being as strong as it used to be. Koby and Hibari go to greet him, but the latter is suddenly frozen by an arriving Kuzan, much to the shock of the Marines, with Garp demanding to know what he is doing.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
