{"content": "For a second it seems like Luffy was caught in that blast as well, but he appears behind Caesar having managed to escape in time. He then hits Caesar with a Gomu Gomu no Jet Stamp attack which seems to finish off the scientist. He calls for Franky and Robin on if they got anything to put him in but just as Franky starts to look, Luffy starts coughing then doubles over before falling unconscious. Caesar recovers, claiming Luffy underestimated him. Meanwhile back inside, Law similarly doubles over in pain and collapses to the floor. He sees footsteps coming toward him and recognizes the figure, asking what he is doing on the island. The person greets Law stating he has grown up since he last saw him.\n\nThe man, Vergo, tells Law that \"they\" do not trust Caesar and have sent Monet in as a deep cover agent to monitor him, revealing that he arrived on an inbound SAD tanker from Dressrosa. Law tries to attack him, but Vergo uses his power on a bamboo stick he is carrying and easily beats Law down.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
