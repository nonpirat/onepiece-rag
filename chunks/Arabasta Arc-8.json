{"content": "In Katorea, the rebels lead by Koza, plan to launch an all-out attack on Alubarna, the capital of Arabasta. The news of this development reaches King Cobra, and his Royal Guards implore him to get ready to fight the Rebel Army. He refuses as he does not want to fight with his own people. Karoo then arrives at the palace and delivers Vivi's letter to the King which informs them of Crocodile's true intention of causing the downfall of Arabasta. The King decides to instead have the Royal Army march on to Rainbase and face Crocodile instead of facing the rebels in order for their country to survive and rebuild.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Arabasta Arc.txt", "title": "Arabasta Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 155 to 217"}}
