{"content": "Despite Usopp's fear, the crew enters, finding it blazing-hot with most of the buildings melted. Looking at the structures, Robin deduces the buildings to be a former government base. As they walk along, Usopp comments on how strange it is that the man on the Den Den Mushi remarked on the coldness of the island despite the intense heat. Luffy wondered if he was just stupid, while Robin pondered if there was a cold area somewhere on this island. On the Thousand Sunny, Nami remarks that the clouds on the opposite side of the island are snow clouds, while Luffy's group finds a city half melted, still burning. As they begin to explore, they stumble upon a massive skull bigger than a giant's that had perished during this catastrophe.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
