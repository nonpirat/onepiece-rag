{"content": "During the chaos, Orochi, who again survived his decapitation managed to sneak through the castle undetected, even witnessing Jack's defeat. He eventually made it to the Treasure Repository, where he barricaded himself inside with the Beasts Pirates riches. He then contacted the dying Kanjuro, directing him to use his ability to create Kazenbo, a giant burning ghost that could pass through walls and with pre-programmed directions to head for the Armory so as to cause maximum damage to all sides. After ending his call, Orochi, believing himself to be safe inside the Treasure Repository, resolved himself to wait for Fukurokuju. However, as he waited, he heard a shamisen in the next room, and when he went to look, he found that, to his happy disbelief, it was none other than Komurasaki.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
