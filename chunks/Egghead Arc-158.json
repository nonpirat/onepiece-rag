He said that even with all-natural light blocked off, Bonney had until age ten at the latest to live. Bonney had overheard this conversation but mistook \"age ten\" as when she would be better. Kuma chose to tell her so, horrified of what will actually happen.\n\nOne year later, the citizens had informed Kuma that Bekori returned causing trouble and planned to burn all of the deadweight people and their homes to the ground.
