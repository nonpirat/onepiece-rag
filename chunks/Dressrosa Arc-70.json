Meanwhile, Usopp, Robin, Rebecca, Bartolomeo, Hack, and the Tontattas ran away from the citizens through the Colosseum stands, and Hack noticed that Sabo had run off. They managed to get to safety on the King's Plateau, where they encountered Doldo, Viola, and Tank Lepanto. Viola revealed that she had the key to Law's Seastone handcuffs, and Doldo was initially wary about trusting pirates to help them, but Viola assured him that Luffy's intentions were genuine.
