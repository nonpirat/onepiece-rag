{"content": "On the first floor of Building R, Caesar sees the damage to his base and is quite upset over it. He orders his men to flood the room so the Shinokuni will power him. When they protest that over 100 of his minions are still in the room, Caesar finally drops the facade, yelling how they are all his guinea pigs, and he does not care how many of them have to perish. The men are aghast at this outburst while Usopp, who was hiding, watches from one of the monitors. However, a few of Caesar's men still remain in denial about Caesar's declaration, thinking it part of his plan against Luffy and open the vents. The gas flood in and Caesar begins to grow, ranting manically how a success his experiment was since two peaceful countries want to procure the gas and how he will become the king of the land of death.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
