{"content": "Jinbe and the guards manage to find the shooter, Hody getting to him first and revealing that it was an unnamed human. He climbs a tower and reveals this to the whole island much to the shock of the citizens. When Neptune finds out about this, he locks himself in the tower to suppress his killing rage. As he does, he confines to the Minister of the Left that even though they shot the shooter and caught him, Otohime would not want him to avenge her as he does not wish to spread his hatred to the children of the island. And that even if he wanted to, he could not bring himself to kill the human. He feels that as a soldier, since he avenged and took prisoner many humans, he was not quantified to help Otohime with her cause only to watch over her. It because of this he feels he cannot take up Otohime's cause since he would be contradicting himself. Though he admits that the contradicting of their hearts is the one thing humans and fish-men have in common.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
