{"content": "Sanji and Duval argue with each other about the wanted poster, while the Straw Hats on the ship are amazed that something like this could happen - Franky has one of his emotional moments whilst the Straw Hats on the dock are amazed at what they are seeing. Brook just laughs (prompting Sanji to yell \"Oh I'm so kicking your ass later, Brook\"). Sanji argues to Duval that he could have changed his appearance all this time, making Duval and the riders sport a \"why did not I think of that\" face while Sanji remarks on their stupidity.\n\nDuval reveals his past to everyone: He was once a mafia boss on a remote island doing his usual job until powerful bounty hunters and Marines came after him and forced to wear his iron mask to protect himself. Sanji beats him up and says he has had enough of his accusations. Duval orders his riders to reveal a steel fishing net and trap Sanji in it, dragging him into the sea.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
