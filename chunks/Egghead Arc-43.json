{"content": "Meanwhile, at Marine HQ, Sakazuki learnt of the Straw Hats presence on Egghead, with the Marines assuming that Vegapunk recruited them after realizing CP0 was targeting him for assassination. After learning that Kizaru was already heading to Egghead on a different mission, the Fleet Admiral then ordered them to contact CP0 and demand that they wait for Marine reinforcement and to not engage the pirates. Kizaru soon learnt of his new orders and promptly ordered all battleships they could mobilize to set course for Egghead. However, at Marine Base G-14, Doll argued with Vice Admiral Garp over the Den Den Mushi, trying to stop him as the base mobilized their battleships to head for Egghead. However, Garp simply yelled for Helmeppo, who heard him, and told them that he was going to Blackbeard's base Hachinosu, to beat up the pirates and rescue Koby, while inviting him aboard.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
