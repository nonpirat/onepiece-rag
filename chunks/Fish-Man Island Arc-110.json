Jinbe is dismayed that Arlong will not respect Tiger's final words. Aladine comforts Jinbe, saying that he understands why Jinbe could not stop Arlong back then. Knowing that trying to do things by force never works out and that either the Marines will stop him, or they (the Sun Pirates) might have to if it comes down to it.
