{"content": "In the B Block Inspection room, Usopp, Kin'emon and Brook have split off from the group to find some Seastone handcuffs at the request of Robin, using Brook's spectral powers to help them. In the SAD room, Law recovers as Smoker and Vergo continue to duel to the death. Near the Biscuits Room, Tashigi and the G-5 Marines are still evading Shinokuni with Sanji taking the rear and kicking any stragglers ahead so no one will be caught in the gas. Finally in the Biscuit Room, Zoro's group has its hands full trying to stop the berserk children and fighting Monet. Robin is wounded by Monet, while she is trying to prevent the berserk children from attacking Mocha, prompting Zoro to engage Monet himself, ordering his crew mates to subdue the kids. With only twenty minutes left before the gas fills the whole B Block, Monet and Zoro continue their battle while Robin assures Nami and Chopper that she is fine.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
