{"content": "Rebecca then headed out for the D Block battle, remembering her past with the Soldier. She had lived with her mother, but when the Donquixote Pirates took over Dressrosa, they went into hiding and her mother was killed. The Soldier brought Rebecca's mother to her and offered to protect her. Despite Rebecca initially refusing, the Soldier stayed by her side as she grew up, getting a house for her and even becoming wanted when saving her from being sold into slavery. He also taught her how to fight, and Rebecca now wished to repay him as she entered the ring to the sound of booing from the crowd, who hated her for being descended from the former king Riku Doldo III. Cavendish silenced the crowd, telling them to get down and fight Rebecca themselves if they hated her. The D Block battle then began.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
