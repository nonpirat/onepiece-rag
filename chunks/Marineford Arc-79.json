{"content": "Ivankov asks someone unseen for help, and none other than Inazuma, conscious once more, emerges. He leaps from Ivankov's hair and, cutting up the ground around him, makes a walkway that leads to the execution platform. Luffy thanks Inazuma and runs up towards Ace. Many of the Marines try to stop Luffy, but they are halted by Whitebeard and his forces. Whitebeard's subordinate crews, as well as Buggy and the prisoners, watch Luffy get closer and closer to Ace. However, Garp leaps down and lands between Luffy and Ace, cracking the ground with his impact. Luffy tells Garp to move aside, but Garp refuses, as he is a Marine Headquarters Vice Admiral.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
