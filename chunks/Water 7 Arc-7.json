{"content": "Luffy insists that he thought long and hard to make the decision and that if Usopp does not like the way he captains then he should just leave. Sanji manages to get Luffy to calm down and the captain apologizes for what he said, but Usopp says those were his true feelings and states that if they are going to abandon Merry, they'll have to leave him behind too. As Usopp leaves the ship, with everyone else looking on tearfully, he turns around and challenges Luffy to a duel over control of the ship at 10:00 that night.\n\nOn the ship, Nami tries to convince Luffy to resolve the matter with words, but Luffy points out that Usopp is not the type to arbitrarily put his life on the line for things he did not strongly believe in. Once he issued the challenge, there was no turning back. Meanwhile, Sanji yells at Zoro for letting the Franky Family escape after they attacked him, because if they did not steal the money from Usopp none of this would have happened, but Nami gets them to calm down.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Water 7 Arc.txt", "title": "Water 7 Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 322 to 374"}}
