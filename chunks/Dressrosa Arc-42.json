{"content": "Zoro and Kin'emon were pursued by Bastille's platoon, and as they ran, Zoro told Luffy to find a way out. Right then, the Sunny came under pursuit by the Big Mom Pirates' ship, with Caesar revealing that they were looking for him because he owed Big Mom money. The Sunny team decided it might be a good idea to continue toward Zou in order to keep Caesar and Momonosuke out of Doflamingo's hands, and leave the rest of the crew with the chance Law gave them to destroy the SMILE Factory. Luffy agreed to this, and also allowed the Sunny team to strike back against the Big Mom Pirates while he, Zoro, and Kin'emon went to rescue Law and take down Doflamingo.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
