{"content": "The Warlords of the Sea, Admirals, and others all look on at the odd group and comment; Mihawk shows subtle surprise while Moria shows frothing rage. Fullbody and Jango comment on how Luffy's normal crew is not with him. Boa Hancock blushes in relief, seeing that Luffy is all right. Koby and Helmeppo are amazed at the fact that Luffy has broken out of Impel Down and arrived in Marineford. Aokiji states that Luffy has brought along tough allies, while Kuma remains silent. Kizaru remarks how he did not think that they would meet again so soon. Marco recalls that he is the one that Ace always talked about. Doflamingo remarks that all of the Warlords, old and new, are together again, and he shows interest in Luffy as a \"famous troublemaker.\" Smoker and Tashigi wonder why Luffy and Crocodile are working together, and Akainu declares that Luffy must be disposed of (notably stating to himself that he is Dragon's son).", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
