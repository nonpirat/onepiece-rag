{"content": "A call is suddenly made to the Elder Stars which the Marines listen into via the Black Den Den Mushi Kizaru has on him. It is then revealed that York is the one who chastises the Elder Stars for coming to kill her along with the other targets despite the deal she made with them, citing if she knew about the Void Century, she would not have told them in the first place. When asked about the Straw Hats and CP0, York claims her calling should be proof she took care of them.\n\nThe Elder Stars get to business and ask if she can make another Mother Flame for them which she agrees to on the condition that they do not harm her, the lab (as it has the power plant needed to make the weapons) and to stick to their deal to make her a Celestial Dragon. They agree before she adds one more request: That they save her from the Straw Hats.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
