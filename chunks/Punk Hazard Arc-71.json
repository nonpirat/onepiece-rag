{"content": "Brownbeard declares he will save his crew from Caesar's lies, though Caesar taunts him as a failure of a New World Captain before defeating him with his Gastanets attack, blowing him up. He then catches up with Usopp and Nami and swiftly defeats them too before retrieving the children and heading back to the lab. As he does, he broadcasts to all the Underworld brokers and cites his intention to do an \"experiment\" on all his captured subjects as a demonstration of his weapon. Among the people watching are Big Mom's crew and Captain Kid's who proclaims he is not interested in the weapon but curious as to what is going on.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
