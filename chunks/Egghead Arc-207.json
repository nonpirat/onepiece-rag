{"content": "- Kuma takes Bonney to Vegapunk, who reveals that he can save her life by transplanting stem cells to cure her in exchange for Kuma to donate his blood to create clone soldiers based off him. However, Saturn contacts Vegapunk and Kuma through a Den Den Mushi carried by Kizaru, having been eavesdropping through their previous conversation, and sets three conditions: The first one is that Kuma must become one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea to replace an unnamed Warlord that was defeated by Ace a few days. The second one is that Kuma must be turned into a cyborg to be used as a weapon. The third one is that Kuma must have his free will removed by Vegapunk.\n\t\t\t- Despite Vegapunk's protests, Kuma agrees on the condition that Bonney will be kept safe at the Sorbet Kingdom. He is also not allowed to see Bonney ever again after her treatment. Vegapunk speculates that it will take a year and a half to fully treat Bonney, and two years to finish converting Kuma.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
