{"content": "Nami is able to kick Zoro's swords back to him, allowing him to defeat the Nyaban brothers. However, Buchi survives and is hypnotized by Jango, turning him into an even bigger threat to Zoro. Nami goes to wake Luffy up, and Jango tries to stop her with his chakram; but at the last second Nami steps on Luffy's face, which gets him up in time to stop the chakram with his rubber body. Kaya then intervenes, holds Kuro at gunpoint, and tries to get him to remember the fun times they had. However, Kuro reveals that he never cared about her and only wants her money, waiting for this day where he can kill her. This causes Kaya to drop the gun in shock. Usopp tries to attack Kuro to defend Kaya, but Kuro injures him badly in retaliation. Kuro is then attacked by Usopp's crew, who have arrived, but he simply brushes off their attack.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Syrup Village Arc.txt", "title": "Syrup Village Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 22 to 41"}}
