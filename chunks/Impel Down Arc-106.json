{"content": "Back inside Impel Down, Bentham reveals himself to everyone's shock and said that he copied Magellan while disguised as Hannyabal. Suddenly, Luffy's voice speaks over the Baby Den Den, to Bon's dismay, as he had hoped Jinbe would wait until later to tell Luffy. Luffy asks Bon why he stayed behind and adds that they were to escape together this time. Everyone else on the ship, even Buggy, Mr. 3, and Iva, call out to Bon while their ship presses on through the Gates. Knowing this, Luffy thanks Bon Kurei for his help. A teary-eyed Bon speaks into the Baby Den Den Mushi, telling Luffy to save Ace as he knows Luffy can do it. The Gates close after the ship makes it through, cutting off their pursuers. Luffy, Iva, and everyone else (excluding Crocodile, Mr. 1, Inazuma, and Jinbe) wails Bon's name while crying. Back at Impel Down, Bon prepares to fight Magellan, with the warden angrily asking if he had any last words, with Bon answering that he had no regrets. He thinks about Luffy and hopes for them to meet again", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
