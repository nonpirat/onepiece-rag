{"content": "Brook starts to reflect on how over the two years he discovered the true power of the Yomi Yomi no Mi in that it emitted a powerful energy which he can distribute via playing music. When his soul leaves his body that is the form of such ectoplasmic energy. Said energy reconnects his head to his body as Zeo starts to celebrate beating one of the Straw Hats. Brook, however, revives calling the energy Tamashii much to Zeo's shock, who promptly tries to hide it. Brook explains that as long as his bones are intact, Zeo's attacks will not go to the core. He then unveils his sword which was sharpened by the Longarm Tribe which he names Soul Solid, firing an attack at Zeo who exclaims its cold. Brook proclaims he will show him the chill of the underworld.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
