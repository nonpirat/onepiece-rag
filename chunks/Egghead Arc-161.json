{"content": "After Kuma returned to Sorbet for Bonney, they both traveled to the Marines Science Division: Lab 8, later known as Egghead, where they met Vegapunk. Vegapunk was amazed by his physique and assured him that Bonney would survive. Upon learning that Kuma was a Buccaneer, Vegapunk requested to use Kuma's blood to clone him into soldiers in return for covering the costs of Bonney's treatment. Kuma asked what the clones would be used for, to which Vegapunk convinced him that they would be used in the Marines to save people's lives. Even though Dragon would not approve of this arrangement, Kuma agreed to Vegapunk's terms, grateful that Bonney could be saved.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
