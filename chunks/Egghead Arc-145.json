{"content": "Saturn himself was present during the event on God Valley and was informed that Kuma was recaptured after having attempted to escape. The ones who did it, however, were other slaves who did not want him to run away as they would be killed for that as well. They were then stopped by two other slaves: a young Emporio Ivankov and Ginny. Ivankov spotted Kuma and said he heard the Buccaneers shared Giant blood, when he then proclaimed he would live on and asked Kuma if he wanted the same.\n\nWith one hour before the start of the competition, the World Nobles began to prepare while the people started to run and hide. At Marine Headquarters, Kong contacted Garp, who was on vacation, and advised him to head to God Valley as the Rocks Pirates were going there to retrieve the \"treasure\" that the World Nobles stole from Hachinosu. Garp initially did not care, saying that the Nobles should have known better, but then he decided to go after hearing that Roger would be there, too.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
