{"content": "Meanwhile, in Grove 21, two more pirates are doing the same: \"The Mad Monk\" Urouge (108,000,000), a Birkan, and a masked individual called \"Massacre Soldier\" Killer (162,000,000) are about to go all out until \"Red Flag\" X Drake (222,000,000), a former Marine officer, breaks the two up. As Drake walks on, the last of the rookies, \"Surgeon of Death\" Trafalgar Law (200,000,000), asks him how many people he's killed.\n\nShakky tells them all the pirates beyond this point are the best of the best. She also reveals that Kid only has a higher bounty than Luffy himself because he caused damage to civilians and that she's rooting for the Straw Hats. Even after hearing this, Luffy responds that he will just relax for the time being but is a bit worried for the engineer. However, Shakky tells him Rayleigh will be fine because he's far stronger than the rookies.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
