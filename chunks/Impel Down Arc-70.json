{"content": "In a stairway leading to Level 4 from Level 5, Luffy, Crocodile and Jinbe rush on. The latter mentions that the execution is set for 3 PM and that Whitebeard could make his move at any point while Ace is on the ocean. Luffy is content on the premise that Ace will not be executed before he is scheduled to. Crocodile gets ahead of the two and dries up the entrance to Level 4, turning it to sand, only to find the security on that level are waiting for them. This does not stop the trio though and they attack at full force. Crocodile uses his Barchan ability, Luffy uses his Gomu Gomu no Ame and Jinbe uses his Fish-Man Karate (which is so powerful he does not even need to touch the guards to knock them back). It becomes evident to the guards that they cannot beat the trio.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
