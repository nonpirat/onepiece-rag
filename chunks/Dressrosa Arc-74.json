{"content": "The gladiators caught up to Luffy and his entourage by climbing the cliff of the Plateau, and the Funk Brothers approached Luffy, offering him a shortcut to the Flower Field on the fourth level of the plateau. Luffy and Law headed into a tunnel, knocking Abdullah and Jeet off, and the latter duo discovered that the Funk Brothers had led them into a trap before Doflamingo arrived and took out the brothers. Luffy and Law received a call from Robin to let them know that she, Bartolomeo, and Rebecca would be going to give Law the key to his handcuffs. However, the tunnel led to a dead end, and Luffy, Law, and Ucy were trapped in a pool of water as they were confronted by Doflamingo. Doflamingo mocked their weak state and shot Ucy with string, but before he could attack further, he was attacked by Abdullah and Jeet. They then discovered that Doflamingo was a string clone, and Abdullah and Jeet told Luffy and Law what happened, revealing that the gladiators had overtaken them to Level 2.
