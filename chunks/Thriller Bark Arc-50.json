{"content": "The fight with Oars continues with Zoro using his Hyakuhachi Pound Ho, which is now much more powerful with his new blade, remarking that that Shusui has a bit of a temper. Oars dodges it. The two pirate crews resolve to get Luffy his shadow back before dawn so he can still fight even if they run out of time. Thriller Bark starts shaking again and the fog clears. Thanks to Oars messing with the rudder, Thriller Bark has drifted out of the Florian Triangle. Meanwhile, Kuma has finally found Moria who tells him that the successor to Crocodile has been chosen: Marshall D. Teach, also known as Blackbeard with a former bounty of zero. Moria takes this with apathy until Kuma tells him the government is afraid of another Warlord being defeated by the Straw Hats.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Thriller Bark Arc.txt", "title": "Thriller Bark Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 442 to 489"}}
