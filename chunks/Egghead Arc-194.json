{"content": "At the Fabriophase, Luffy and Sanji tried getting Vegapunk to come with them, but he said he was better off where he was and asked for them to protect Bonney. They were approached by Saturn in his Beast Form, who tried attacking them with venom on his legs. Luffy told Sanji to escort Vegapunk, but Kizaru kicked Sanji and caused further injury to Vegapunk with Ama no Murakumo. Luffy then told Sanji to get to the back of the island with Vegapunk while he stayed to deal with Kizaru and Saturn by himself. As Sanji went with him, he wondered why Vegapunk was smiling, right before a computer system broadcasted a recording of Vegapunk to the world, where he promised to reveal the shocking truth about it.\n\nStory Impact", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
