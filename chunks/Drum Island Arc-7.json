{"content": "In the aftermath, Luffy continues to try and recruit Chopper to his crew. Chopper, remembering how his old mentor, Dr. Hiriluk, wanted him to go out to sea and see the world, decides to join the Straw Hats. When he goes to tell Kureha this, she flat out refuses to let him leave, chasing after the reindeer with a variety of weapons until Chopper escapes down the mountain with the rest of the Straws Hats on a sled. Turns out however, Kureha's refusal was all an act (or in a way, reverse psychology) to convince Chopper to leave as she does not like tearful goodbyes. Dr. Kureha then has most of the villagers set up cannons pointed into the air and uses the \"cure for the country's cold heart\" that Dr. Hiriluk had developed before he died, to produce the image of falling cherry-blossoms on the snow, as a sendoff to her beloved student. After witnessing this, the Straw Hats finally set off for Arabasta.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Drum Island Arc.txt", "title": "Drum Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 130 to 154"}}
