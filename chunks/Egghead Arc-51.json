{"content": "When Stussy questioned Lucci's decision to fight Luffy, the agent simply stated that he did not see Luffy as an Emperor. All of a sudden, the security seemed to knock off, and though Lucci wished to exercise caution, believing it to be a trap, when the three agents used Geppo to reach the Labophase and still did not receive a counterattack, Kaku believed that this was an opportunity. The three then spotted the Thousand Sunny, and at Lucci's order Kaku attacked it with Rankyaku \"Amane Dachi\". Thankfully Zoro, who was napping aboard the ship cancelled out the attack and engaged the agents. As it turns out Bonney had found Vegapunk and pursued him through the facility, demanding he restore her father, even though he could not and that he had a good reason.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
