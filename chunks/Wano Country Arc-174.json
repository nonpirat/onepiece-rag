{"content": "Throughout all this, the CP0 agents examined the state of the war in their private Guest Parlor, using a Go board to illustrate the two sides. They noted that a total of 5,000 casualties have appeared on both sides, with the ratio between Beasts Pirates and the Alliance being 24,000:3,000. However, thanks to Queen causing the Pleasures and Waiters on his own side to revolt, the gap is actually smaller, being 20,000:7,000. When Tama activated her ability, the CP0 agents altered the board again, with 300 Headliners being tamed by Tama, with an additional 2,000 Gifters under their direct command turning against the Beasts Pirates, and a thousand additional casualties during the surprise betrayal, the gap narrowed again with 16,000:9,000 in favor of the Beasts Pirates. The agents then discussed how Who's-Who needed to be eliminated due to his defection.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
