{"content": "Just as Kaidou swung at Zoro, Law used his ability and switched with the Pirate Hunter, before stabbing the King of the Beasts in the throat with Injection Shot. He then defended himself from Kaidou's follow up with Curtain though he was still sent flying. Zoro, while entrusting Law with the aftermath, then used his strongest attack, Nine Sword Style: Asura Bakkei: Moja no Tawamure, when Kaidou targeted the still unconscious Luffy. The attack managed to scar the Emperor, who was shocked, having thought that Zoro might have used Haoshoku Haki, though the swordsman denied it before collapsing. When Law attempted to help the Pirate Hunter, Kaidou struck both of them with Raimei Hakke.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
