{"content": "- Information about the Wano Country is revealed. As stated by Brook, the Wano Country is a closed-door kingdom who are not affiliated with the World Government, nor do they allow the Marines to go near them. Two samurais, Kin'emon and Momonosuke are introduced and become traveling companions of the Straw Hats to help save Kin'emon's ally at Dressrosa. Also, the status of the Wano Country as well as their connection to Kaidou is briefly foreshadowed in this arc which would lead to the events of the Wano Country Arc.\n\t- After introducing Momonosuke as Ki'nemon's son in this arc, the Zou Arc would later clarify Kin'emon's true relationship with Momonosuke as his retainer and not his father under the orders to have Momonosuke pretend to be his son as to not attract Kaidou or his crew.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
