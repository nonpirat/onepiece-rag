The Marine Officer goes on further, even revealing Buggy's \"brotherly\" relationship with Red-Haired Shanks\u00a0and his past apprenticeship\u00a0on Gol D. Roger's crew, much to the shock of the inmates on board, although they found no connection between him and Ace, they still conclude that he is helping Luffy save him (although this was not the case). The Marine Officer lastly mentions they will not open the gate for them and that they will not be able to survive since they are on the marine current. However, Luffy responds back that he will rescue his brother no matter what before hanging up.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
