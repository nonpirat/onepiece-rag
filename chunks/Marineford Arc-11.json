{"content": "Whitebeard, impressed with his spirit and strength, offered Ace the choice to join his crew, which Ace refused at first. He was suddenly knocked out, and he gained consciousness on Moby Dick, where he was greeted by Thatch, the Fourth Division Commander. Thatch explained that Ace's crew tried to get him back but were once more defeated and brought on board Whitebeard's ship. Despite this, Ace was not treated as a prisoner, and yet he still stubbornly refused to be part of the crew. Instead, he tried to assassinate Whitebeard numerous times (a total of 100 times, according to the crew) all of which ended in failure. Eventually, Ace gave up and officially joined after Marco revealed that all the men aboard Whitebeard's ship, who are hated around the world, see him as a father, and likewise in kind he calls them his \"sons.\"", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
