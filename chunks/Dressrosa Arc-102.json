{"content": "When Pica came to the Plateau and attacked, Ideo was able to land a hit on Dellinger, but was soon overpowered. On the third level, Bartolomeo shielded himself and Cavendish as Gladius made the ground rupture, and Robin went up to the Flower Field to help Rebecca. Bartolomeo protected her from Gladius' attacks before he and Cavendish both went on the offensive, and as this happened, Gladius saw Dellinger and told him to help. However, Ideo pressed his attack on Dellinger, and the fighting fish fish-man hybrid had to finish off his opponent by growing a set of fangs and biting into him. Dellinger then went to Level 3, but things had quickly changed as Cavendish had become Hakuba, and before he could react, Dellinger was swiftly struck down.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
