{"content": "In a flashback to Koby's training days, Garp was a guest speaker in one of his classes and asks a hypothetical question about an old man and a baby who were stuck on an island full of ravenous beasts and who the cadets would save. Koby answers to just give the boat to the two and stay behind but Garp deems that wrong, saying the best answer is to just leave the old man to die and save the baby as they have a higher life expectancy. This gets him chewed out by the instructor, however, but Garp thinks the youth are full of potential. The story then goes to the present day and three weeks prior on Amazon Lily. Some of the Marines have been captured by Blackbeard and Vice Admiral Yamakaji was willing to sacrifice them to avoid any further battle with an Emperor. Koby however steps in and offers himself up in exchange for the officers which Blackbeard accepted.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
