{"content": "Whitebeard and Blackbeard exchange a few words, to which Whitebeard snarls that he no longer sees Blackbeard as his son. Blackbeard, in return, says that while he really respected Whitebeard, he had gotten too old and weak and thus was unable to save Ace. He adds that it was wasteful to have spared Ace's life when he captured him at Banaro Island. Whitebeard then attempts to punch Blackbeard with a quake punch, but Blackbeard blocks it with his Kurouzu. Blackbeard then asked Whitebeard how it feels to not be able to create earthquakes. Whitebeard strikes Blackbeard with his naginata, pinning him down and using his Gura Gura ability to choke Blackbeard.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
