{"content": "In Bellamy's \"New Age\", dreams will be worthless. He explains that so many people are focused on searching for dream treasures like the City of Gold and the One Piece, that they ignore all of the real treasures around them. Bellamy attacks Luffy and Zoro while the other people in the bar start throwing things at them, but despite Nami's urging, they refuse to fight back, paralleling how Shanks and his crew did not fight back against Higuma when he and his crew attacked them in Makino's bar.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Jaya Arc.txt", "title": "Jaya Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 218 to 236"}}
