{"content": "Brook and the minister yell to both Luffy and Megalo as they leave the tower, but neither hears them. The minister tells Brook to hurry into the room to check on the princess. But once they get there, Shirahoshi is nowhere to be found. The minister panics, saying that this is a national crisis. One of the pirates goes on to attack Brook, demanding to know the location of the switch that opens the connection corridor that links the palace to Fish-Man Island. The pirates say that they have to find it, or they will be killed. Back at Coral Hill, Chopper complains to Sanji about beating up the Ammo Knights. Sanji counters that they were going to handcuff him, and that Chopper attacked them first before complimenting the new Kung Fu Point.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
