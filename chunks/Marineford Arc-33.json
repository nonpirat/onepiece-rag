{"content": "Kuma fires one of his beams from his mouth, hoping to incinerate Luffy and Ivankov; the two dodge the blow as Ivankov grabs onto Luffy and rolls out of the way. Ivankov is shocked that Kuma would attack him, remembering that the two used to be friends. As Luffy continues his assault, Hina reappears to capture Luffy, transforming her arms into long iron fences. Luffy manages to jump out of the ring using Gear 2, as it ensnares Hina's Marine allies. Watching on with glee, Moria somehow manages to bring previously unseen zombies out of the earth to battle Luffy.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
