{"content": "Back in Vegapunk's lab, one of the centaurs is taking the special treatment but all the effects only sicken him further before Caesar kills him outright. Monet claims it as a failure, but Caesar disagrees, claiming the explosion he did four years ago was part of his schemes. Caesar vows to show the World Government that he will prove he is the greatest scientist in the world.\n\nBack with Smoker, he tells his men that Caesar was actually the one that set off the chemical incident four years ago and Vegapunk was blamed for it. He states that his work in mass murder weapons was illegal and because of how dangerous he was they arrested him, but Caesar managed to escape. Smoker states that if Caesar is continuing his research now, then there will be another incident like before if they do not stop him soon.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
