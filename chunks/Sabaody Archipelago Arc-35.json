{"content": "As his staff rush to find a doctor, one of the captives, a giant, tells another that he knows he was the cause of Disco fainting with his \"burst of spirit\". When asked who he is, the culprit just claims he's an old man that cannot ignore a young girl. This man turns out to be\u00a0Silvers Rayleigh, former First Mate of the Roger Pirates, The Pirate King's Right Hand.\n\nAt a Marine base, it is revealed to Garp that Rayleigh is being sold at the auction house, who comments that he probably is selling himself to pay off a gambling debt. He also tells the Marine reporting to him not to mention this to anyone else and that he will take care of it. Garp says that Rayleigh is not to be underestimated just because of his age and many good men could be hurt or worse if handled the wrong way.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
