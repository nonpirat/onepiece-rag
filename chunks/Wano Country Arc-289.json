{"content": "Meanwhile, Luffy, Zoro, Sanji and Jinbe witnessed the scene in pride of Momonosuke's courage, while also wondering the source of the massive Haki burst, they had sensed then. Shortly afterwards, Yamato met up with the observing Straw Hats and stated his intention to stay on the island, as threats as strong as Ryokugyu may pop up again, claiming he would come up with an excuse to placate Momonosuke if he asked. Just as Luffy agreed, as it would take a load of his mind, Marco flew up and said his goodbyes, stating he found a passing ship close by (a.k.a. the Red Hair Pirates) who would be willing to take him home. When Luffy wished to express his thanks for the Summit War of Marineford, Marco just brushed it off and flew away, but not before mentioning how Ace would be proud of his little brother if he could see him now.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
