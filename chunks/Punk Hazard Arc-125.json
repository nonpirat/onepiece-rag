Baby 5 and Buffalo go to do so but notice something else on the tanker, a robot, which is revealed to be the General Franky, who likewise notices the two above him. Franky opens fire upon the pair, hitting Buffalo. Baby 5 returns fire with her gatling gun, but Franky is unharmed by the attack and instead throws his shield at them.
