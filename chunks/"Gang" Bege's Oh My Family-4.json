{"content": "Meanwhile, the Tontatta Pirates were sailing back from the Levely when they find a Tartes ship with the injured Pound on it near the coast of Green Bit.\n\nBack at Dressrosa, Lola asks Gotti to marry her as thanks for saving her. But before Gotti could answer, the Marines suddenly attack, forcing both the Fire Tank and Rolling Pirates to make a hasty getaway from the country. Both crews arrive at the Dressrosa port and find the Tontatta Pirates along with a patched up Pound, who Chiffon recognizes as the old man they saw when they escaped from Cacao Island. Pound, in turn, was brought to tears upon seeing both of his daughters and revealed himself to be their father, shocking the sisters. However, they refused to believe him and make their escape from the island while leaving behind Pound for the incoming Marines.", "metadata": {"source": "database/\"Gang\" Bege's Oh My Family.txt", "title": "\"Gang\" Bege's Oh My Family", "Chapters": "Chapters 948 to 994"}}
