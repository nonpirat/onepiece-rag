{"content": "Meanwhile, in the West of the island in Waterwheel Town, Dosun was beaten and tied up along with his unit with the residents of the area looking after them. One of them suggest using Dosun as a hostage to prevent Hody from attacking but Dosun counters that Hody will just view them as weak and have them killed. Continuing that he always been that way, hating fish-men who interacted with human pirates or those who were given blood by humans as he feels the blood of humans are tainted and that anyone who stood in their way was an enemy to them. In the midst of the speech, one of the New Fish-Man Pirates manage to shoot an Energy Steroid into Dosun's mouth and he gradually recovers till he breaks free of his chains. He then attacks the residents, vowing revenge on Fukaboshi before telling his men they're heading for Gyoncorde Plaza.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
