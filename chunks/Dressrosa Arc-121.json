{"content": "Doflamingo initially overpowered Luffy with awakened attacks and managed to take control of the Straw Hat. However, as the Birdcage began cutting into the King's Plateau, Luffy activated Gear 4 and broke the strings on him as he flew into the air. Doflamingo taunted Luffy, saying that he would get a new kingdom to replace the people in Dressrosa as though they were trash. Luffy blew into his arm, and Doflamingo put up both a defense and attack, but it was not enough as Luffy broke through his strings with Gomu Gomu no King Kong Gun and hit the Warlord of the Sea, sending him falling into the ground with a force so great that it ripped the ground asunder and propelled him all the way to the underground port, breaking his sunglasses. Luffy fell unconscious, and Law brought him back down to his side. The Birdcage then came down, and Gatz proclaimed Luffy as the winner against Doflamingo as the people of Dressrosa rejoiced and Kyros shed tears for the first time in ten years.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
