{"content": "Most of the Supernovas are staying in Grove 24. First off comes Capone \"Gang\" Bege (138,000,000), a mafia-type pirate who is dining at a restaurant and complaining of the food. When one of his crew tries to warn him of the Marines, he attacks him with a fork. Then \"Big Eater\" Jewelry Bonney (140,000,000), who's in the same restaurant, is living up to her title by eating an enormous amount of food and demanding more of it despite the cooks going as fast as they can. There is also \"The Magician\" Basil Hawkins (249,000,000), who tells a pirate who got spaghetti spilled on him that it's an unlucky day for him. In another section of the grove, two of the rookies Eustass \"Captain\" Kid (315,000,000) and \"Roar of the Sea\" Scratchmen Apoo (198,000,000) are fighting against one another.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
