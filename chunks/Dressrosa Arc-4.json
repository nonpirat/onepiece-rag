{"content": "Soon afterwards, Zoro noticed that Shusui was missing as the citizens noted that the \"fairies\" had come to pickpocket some things. Unwilling to accept the loss of his sword, Zoro spotted it and chased after the fairy, and Sanji and Kin'emon pursued him. Luffy chased after him as well, but Franky held him back, having gotten the idea to get information about the SMILE Factory. They interrogated one of the pirates that the blind man had attacked in the alley, but he claimed no knowledge of the Factory's whereabouts. He said the higher-ranking members who knew would be gathered in the Corrida Colosseum today, as a tournament was being held with the Mera Mera no Mi as the prize. People had come from all over the world to win it but would have to face the Donquixote Pirates' Machvise, Dellinger, Lao G, and Senor Pink as well as the \"Hero of the Colosseum,\" Diamante. Luffy wanted to get Ace's Devil Fruit for himself, and Franky encouraged him to do so as they headed for the Colosseum.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
