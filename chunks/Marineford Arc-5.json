{"content": "Shortly after Roger died, the Marines arrived on Baterilla, going off reports that Roger had acted unlike himself on the island. They begin to investigate all newborns, mothers, and pregnant women, even giving orders to kill any mother who may seem suspicious to them. Through it all, however, Rouge managed to keep Ace in her womb and avoid their notice. Eventually, the Marines left the island, and Rouge, under the care of Garp, was able to bear Ace safely. However, she only had a moment to hold her son before she died from exhaustion. A few years afterward, Garp left Ace under the care of Curly Dadan, a friend of his and a caretaker of Luffy, which is how the two first met. Garp then goes back to his last meeting with Ace, who mentioned that both Luffy and he had the blood of world-class criminals in their veins, which he meant Luffy having the Revolutionary leader, Dragon's blood, and Ace the Pirate King's. He also took Portgas as his surname out of love for his mother, who saved his life.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
