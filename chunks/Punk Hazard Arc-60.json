{"content": "Some of Caesar's men attack Luffy, Robin and Franky but Franky easily takes them out while Luffy wonders where Caesar could be. Tashigi confronts Luffy, demanding to know what he is plotting but Luffy easily dodges her smoke attack and pins her down using Haki wondering why \"Smoker\" got so weak. Smoker, seeing this, attacks Luffy from behind to Luffy's surprise that \"Tashigi\" got much stronger. Robin then points out that their bodies were switched, causing Luffy to laugh when he realizes who \"Tashigi\" is. He tells Smoker he will hold off their fight until he gets his body back, much to Smoker's chagrin. Franky meanwhile manages to blast the lab door open.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
