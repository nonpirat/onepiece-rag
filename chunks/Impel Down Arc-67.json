{"content": "Crocodile had at first lost interest in the outside world, but hearing that Whitebeard was going to war with the Marines has caused him to reconsider as it is a perfect chance to take down the legendary pirate. Luffy, however, wants nothing to do with him, the Arabasta incident still fresh in his mind. Iva on the other hand, suggests freeing him, much to Luffy's shock, though reveals that he has long since known the former Warlord of the Sea as far back as when he was a rookie and should Crocodile get out of line, he will take care of him himself since he knows of Crocodile's weakness. Iva states he is only willing to free him if Crocodile helps out (much to Crocodile's chagrin). Jinbe suddenly speaks out, begging to help, as he wants to save Ace as badly as Luffy, even willing to die \"a glorious death\" in doing so. Noting this, Luffy agrees to his wishes. Inazuma frees Crocodile and Jinbe of their chains, and the five prepare to break out of Impel Down.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
