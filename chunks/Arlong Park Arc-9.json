{"content": "Back in the present, Marine forces led by Captain Nezumi land on the island. Nezumi has Genzo take him to Nami and Nojiko's household, where he accuses Nami of harboring illegal money. Nami tries to stop them, but the Marines find the money. Genzo reveals to the Marines that the money is for the repurchase of the town, admitting to a startled Nami that he and the townspeople always knew what she was doing after she \"joined\" Arlong. Nami tries to prevent the Marines from taking the money, but fails. Nojiko is also shot in the stomach when she tries to protect her. Nami runs back to Arlong and accuses him of sending the Marines to look for her money. However, Arlong denies it, claiming he never broke their deal, before telling her that if she wants her village back, she will just need to start again from scratch. Nami runs off as he laughs.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Arlong Park Arc.txt", "title": "Arlong Park Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 69 to 95"}}
