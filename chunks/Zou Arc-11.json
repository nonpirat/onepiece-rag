{"content": "Meanwhile, Law reunited with his crew.\n\nWanda told the story of Jack's invasion as she led the Straw Hats to Inuarashi. She revealed that they had thought the Bell of Welcome had rung, but it was actually the Raid Bell as Zou was being invaded. Zunesha howled as a giant mammoth stepped foot into Mokomo Dukedom, ordering the people to surrender Raizo to him. The minks then realized that they were being invaded by the Beasts Pirates led by Kaidou's right-hand man, Jack. The latter once more demanded the minks give up Raizo, but the minks refused, mentioning Raizo was not on the island. Despite their refusal, Jack destroyed a large part of the city while ordering his subordinates, the Pleasures, to lay waste to the rest. The minks fought back, easily defeating the Pleasures, forcing Jack to bring in the Gifters, led by Sheepshead.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Zou Arc.txt", "title": "Zou Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 802 to 824"}}
