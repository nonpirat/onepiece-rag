{"content": "- The Jaya Arc introduced many important characters. All these introductions were related to Blackbeard, the pirate who Ace was looking for, whose attempt to capture Luffy\u00a0was stopped by the Knock Up Stream. Blackbeard needed to capture a big name in order to be given the open position of Warlord of the Sea, as Laffitte explained to the Marines during their meeting. It was during this meeting that Fleet Admiral Sengoku and Vice Admiral Tsuru were introduced along with Warlords Bartholomew Kuma and Donquixote Doflamingo. Shortly thereafter, the Five Elders were seen for the first time as well. Also, Whitebeard was finally introduced, when Rockstar delivered Shanks' message to him, and Marco and Jozu made their first appearance, even if not introduced.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Jaya Arc.txt", "title": "Jaya Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 218 to 236"}}
