{"content": "Skypiea Arc(Chapters 237 to 302, Volumes 26 to 32)\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nHaving ridden the Knock Up Stream, the Straw Hats find themselves in a sea of clouds (which, as they find out, has the same effect as normal water on a Devil Fruit user), but before they have a chance to relax, they are quickly attacked by a strange man in a mask who is riding on the clouds. The crew are unable to defend themselves, but they are thankfully saved by an old knight named Gan Fall, who rides on a bird with Devil Fruit powers named Pierre. He points out to them that the reason that they could not fight back against the \"Guerrilla\" was due to the thin air, though immediately afterwards the crew says that they are starting to get used to it. Gan Fall gives them a whistle to summon him in case they run into more trouble, and the crew continues on.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Skypiea Arc.txt", "title": "Skypiea Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 237 to 302"}}
