{"content": "Dressrosa returned to peace under King Riku's rule, and a new era began as the citizens began coexisting with the Tontatta Tribe. CP0 came to Dressrosa, among them being Rob Lucci and Spandam, only to find the Revolutionaries gone with Doflamingo's weapons. Elsewhere, the Marines set sail for Impel Down, and Fujitora stated that he would take a trip while he was currently barred from entering Marine bases. Below deck, Doflamingo talked to Tsuru, saying that his downfall would plunge the world into chaos as various groups would aim for the top and destabilize the current system of power, but she paid no mind to his words. Behind the Marine fleet, a pirate ship approached, and its captain, Jack, was intent on going to rescue Doflamingo despite the powerful Marines in the fleet.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
