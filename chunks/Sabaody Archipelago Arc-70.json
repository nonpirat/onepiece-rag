They soon start to discuss what to do next when someone calls out to them. Out from the sky drops the axe-wielding figure, along with yet another Kuma cyborg, in the middle of the Straw Hats. The figure introduces himself as Sentomaru and the Kuma clone known as a Pacifista, PX-1 (the one the Straw Hats defeated was PX-4).\n\nPX-1 soon fires on the group forcing the Straw Hats to dodge. This prompts Luffy to decides they must now split up and run. Sanji sticks with Nami with Franky tagging along. Usopp goes with Zoro with Brook joining as well out of concern for Zoro's injuries. Leaving Luffy, Robin, and Chopper together. The three groups run in different direction promising to meet up in three days.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
