{"content": "Having seen the determination shown by both Whitebeard, his subordinate crews, and Luffy, Ace finally states that he cares not what fate has in store for him, whether he is to be saved or killed. As Luffy, Ivankov, and Jinbe break through the Marine forces, Whitebeard recognizes Buggy and asks if he wants to take his head. Whitebeard proposes that the two instead team up temporarily to fight the Marines before Buggy takes his head, which Buggy agrees to. When Marco asks why Whitebeard would deal with someone as insignificant as Buggy, Whitebeard explains that it would be troublesome if they had to fight the inmates alongside the Marines.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
