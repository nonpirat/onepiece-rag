{"content": "Fast forward, several years later in the West Blue, the World Nobles organize a tournament, the Native Hunting Competition, where they eradicate an entire population, and which also takes place every three years. The site of that year's tournament was God Valley, which was unaffiliated with the World Government and was resented by the World Nobles due to its name feeling blasphemous to the World Nobles. Their goal for the tournament was to kill all the people on the island, as well as some troublesome slaves and then claim the island and all its rich resources in the name of the World Government. When the king heard about the government, he objected but was quickly slain by a young Figarland Garling (who in return suffered a massive deduction, but was not upset about it since it would give the other contestants a good handicap).", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
