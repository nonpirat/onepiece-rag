{"content": "Seven years later, Ace, at age 17, is finally setting sail: he is on a little boat with a triangular sail and sports many of his trademark objects: his hat with the two smiles, the orange belt with his initial on the buckle, the armband on the left arm, and his green bag with a black pattern on it. He happily says goodbye to the ones at the shore; Luffy, who is now 14, Makino, Woop Slap, Dogra, Magra, and the other bandits, who wish him good luck in return. Dadan was not there as she remained in her hideout. Her subordinates inform her that Ace is already gone. She appears to remain unmoved upon hearing it, claiming that Garp will be angry, and that Ace is always causing trouble. However, as her bandits tell her that Ace sent her a message, \"Thank you,\" she burst out in tears, showing her sadness.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
