However, the others commented that it was necessary to prevent Luffy's Devil Fruit from awakening, revealing that, what was thought to be the Paramecia-type Gomu Gomu no Mi, is actually the Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit, Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika, a fruit named after a god. They also commented how the World Government had been attempting to secure the fruit for over 800 years, but it has always escaped their grasp, even believing that it was by the will of the Zoan fruit itself had been evading them.
