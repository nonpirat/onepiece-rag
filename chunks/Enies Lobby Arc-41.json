{"content": "Back at the battle, Lucci hits Luffy with the most powerful Rokushiki technique he knows, damaging Luffy heavily. However, it only leaves Luffy more determined than ever to defeat Lucci. Meanwhile, the Buster Call ships realized that Rob Lucci and Luffy are in the tower, so they destroyed half the bridge and isolated the tower. The fleet aimed at where the rest of the crew were waiting, to capture Nico Robin and Zoro and the rest of the crew. The crew get ready to fight back so that Robin will not be recaptured. The Marines are astonished by the crew, noting that one pirate crew was able to take down Enies Lobby and CP9.\n\nSogeking spotted Luffy and Lucci in the tower and called out to the pirate. Franky, Sogeking, Zoro, and Sanji, who are on the bridge, cheered him on. Newly motivated, Luffy prepares to fight Lucci again. Lucci, upon seeing the crew, remarked that it was quite the crew, but that evil cannot win.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Enies Lobby Arc.txt", "title": "Enies Lobby Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 375 to 430"}}
