{"content": "Three more years pass, and finally, at 17 years old, Luffy is ready to set sail himself. He says goodbye to the Bandits, who cannot go to Foosha Village because of its civilians. He thanks them, and then tells Dadan that he dislikes mountain bandits, to which she gets angry and shouts at him, but when the boy says that he likes them instead, the woman bursts out in tears, as she did three years before for Ace's departure. Luffy is then seen on a dinghy in Foosha Village. One of the citizens asks him to take one of their old fishing boats, but the boy refuses, content with his little boat. He then cries Sabo's name, telling his deceased brother of his departure. After saying farewell to his friends, he sets sail, and he rapidly defeats the King of the Coast off-screen, a feat commented on by Dadan, Dogra, and Magra, hidden behind a wall.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
