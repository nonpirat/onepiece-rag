{"content": "After wrecking the pirates' ship and leaving them barely alive, Hody tells them to return to the surface to tell the humans about what happened and who is responsible. As Gyro and his crew float to the surface, Hody declares that the New Fish-Man Pirates will show the world that fish-men are the supreme race and that they will take control of Fish-Man Island from King Neptune.\n\nA few hours earlier, Ishilly and two other unwitting mermaids began opening the barrel that Caribou was sealed in, thinking that the barrel contained treasure or expensive alcohol. After Ishilly loosens a few bolts, Caribou pops out and terrifies the three mermaids. As the unfortunate mermaids try to flee and scream for help, Caribou captures them within himself using his Numa Numa no Mi powers, which allow him to become and create an artificial swamp. He then gleefully comments that since he is on the island, he can capture as many mermaids as he wishes and sell them into slavery.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
