{"content": "The Straw Hats make a stop at Syrup Village in search of a ship. Usopp is overjoyed to have real pirates arrive, and greets them with a cleverly-conceived act designed to fool the pirates into believing he is the commander of his own huge pirate fleet. The ruse fails, and Luffy and friends proceed into Syrup Village unhindered. Soon, the Straw Hats become friends with Usopp when Luffy discovers he is the son of Yasopp, one of the pirates in Shanks' crew.\n\nKuro's long awaited time to act arrives as he meets with his former first mate Jango, but his identity and plan is accidentally overheard by Luffy and Usopp. Jango hypnotizes Luffy to fall sleep, who then falls off a cliff and is believed to be dead by everyone present. However, they are unaware that Luffy has survived because of his Devil Fruit powers.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Syrup Village Arc.txt", "title": "Syrup Village Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 22 to 41"}}
