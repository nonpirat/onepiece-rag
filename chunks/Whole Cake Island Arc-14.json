{"content": "Luffy continued fighting Cracker, but was unable to injure the Sweet Commander even with Gear 2 and Gear 3. Cracker spawned additional limbs on his body and created copies of his sword and shield, allowing him to overpower Luffy. However, when Cracker stated that Sanji would not want to return to the Straw Hats, an enraged Luffy activated Gear 4 and successfully injured him with Kong Gun. However, as Luffy split Cracker's body in half with additional attacks, the real Cracker leaped out and cut him in the arm, injuring him. Cracker revealed that he was operating in a biscuit body crafted by the Bisu Bisu no Mi, and created more biscuit bodies that shielded him and allowed him to gain an edge offensively.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Whole Cake Island Arc.txt", "title": "Whole Cake Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 825 to 902"}}
