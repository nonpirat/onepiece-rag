{"content": "Some Donquixote soldiers then came to take Gladius away, and Viola reported to Leo that she had seen Giolla using Mansherry to heal the fallen Donquixote Pirates, including the officers, on the first floor of the palace. Leo and Kabu were urged to hurry, and Giolla discovered that she could use Mansherry's Chiyu Chiyu no Mi powers to heal her fallen comrades by just forcing her tears to land on them. Leo and Kabu then came in right as Mansherry's tears were beaten out of her. Kabu moved the Donquixote Pirates out of the tears' path, and Leo stitched them and Giolla together, pulling them all onto her and defeating her. He rescued Mansherry, and on her request, carried her out of the palace. Giolla tried to report this to Doflamingo, as Mansherry was also their contingency to repair the SMILE Factory, but was unable to do so.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
