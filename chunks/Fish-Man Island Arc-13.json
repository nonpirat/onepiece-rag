{"content": "Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji are in their personal coating bubble, which Caribou calls \"Barefoot Coating,\" which are essentially man-made diving suits. Caribou tells them they can now go fight without damaging the ship and can find their way back using a rope lifeline. Usopp initially complains about this, but when Caribou explains which would be better, fighting on the ship or away from it, Usopp changes his mind. The \"Monster Trio\" heads out, leaving their lifelines behind as they feel they will get in their way. The Kraken attacks again, and Franky fires rockets from his shoulders, repelling a tentacle. The Kraken attacks with another one, but Chopper eats a Rumble Ball and goes into Guard Point, protecting the ship. The Sunny is thrown back toward a mountain as a result, but Robin manages to conjure two large hands and keep it from crashing.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
