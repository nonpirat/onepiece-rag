{"content": "Suddenly, a man steps up from the crowd and threatens Ivankov with a bazooka claiming that his father who was a king who traveled to the Kamabakka Kingdom and came back as an Okama which tore their kingdom apart. He proceeds to fire the bazooka in which Ivankov deflects the missile by winking, striking the man instead. He goes on to demonstrate his power by changing the man into a woman in which he/she runs out of the room in embarrassment. After seeing his powers, Bon Kurei begs Iva to save Luffy. Ivankov tells Bon that he was healed because Luffy begged them to help him despite being at death's door from Magellan's poison. He further tells Bon Kurei that Luffy has been undergoing medical treatment for hours which happened to be pretty rough and has been screaming nonstop in a locked cave. He also remarks that he still has two days left of treatment with 16 hours before Ace's execution.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
