{"content": "Back on the Sunny, Franky, Usopp and Sanji are taking a break when Chopper calls them on their Den Den Mushi. He frantically informs them that Camie was kidnapped. Peterman's gang somehow got the drop on Luffy's group and manage to steal her away, making matters worse is that they do not know which group took her and where she is since the island is very big and there are many human shops. Sanji tells them to stand by, since they are dealing with a kidnapping gang, they need experts in this field. Sanji then reveals he's calling the Flying Fish Riders.\n\nDuval and his gang soon reach the Thousand Sunny. But soon he and the Straw Hats get to the task at hand. Back at Sabaody Park, Luffy, Hatchan and Pappag have split off to search for Camie despite Sanji telling them to stay put, leaving Chopper and Brook behind. The Fish Riders reach them, and they set off to search. The Flying Fish Riders then split up to find kidnapping teams while a few go off to collect the remaining Straw Hats.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
