{"content": "- Kuma was thrown in jail for attacking Sorbet Kingdom's soldiers in protest for the enslavement of the elders he cared for. This incident was a consequence of the policies instilled by Sorbet's King, Bekori, who had segregated the southern portion of the country from national jurisdiction (turning it into a lawless land in the process) in order to reduce the population-dependent Heavenly Tribute that the Sorbet Kingdom owed to the World Government. Ginny was arrested as well for protesting Kuma's imprisonment.\n\t\t\t- Monkey D. Dragon and Ivankov eventually attacked the Sorbet Kingdom, overthrowing Bekori's rule. Kuma and Ginny joined the Freedom Fighters right after being freed by Dragon and Ivankov.\n\t\t\t- Dragon reveals that he was once in the Marines but left due to differences in views about Justice.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
