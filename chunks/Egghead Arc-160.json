{"content": "At sea, Kuma encountered Bekori who led a Marine fleet to try and kill him, but Kuma managed to sink all the ships, resulting in him being assigned a bounty. Kuma would later visit many islands to ask the residents if they knew a cure for Sapphire Scales, to no success. He also came across the Revolutionary Army again, where he spoke with Dragon about what has happened since he left. Per Kuma's blessing, Belo Betty gained the role as commander of the East Army after Ginny's death left the position vacant for years. Dragon also told Kuma about the scientist Dr. Vegapunk and that he was transferring to a new lab after the incident at Punk Hazard, in which Kuma could ask him about curing Bonney's disease. Kuma thanked Dragon for this opportunity and said he would return to the Revolutionary Army after it is done.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
