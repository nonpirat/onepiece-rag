{"content": "Meanwhile, Zoro fends off the shipwrights using the backs of his swords and he, along with Nami and Chopper, make their way upstairs.\n\nIceburg refuses to cooperate with the CP9 so Lucci (who, as it turns out, can speak normally), asks Kaku to check Iceburg's pulse to gauge his reaction to his \"theory.\" Lucci gives his theory as to what happened to the Pluton blueprints. It was assumed that Iceburg was the last apprentice of the shipwright Tom and inherited the blueprints as a result, since reports said that his other apprentice, Cutty Flam, died when he was run over by the Sea Train. However, Cutty Flam is not actually dead\u2014he continues to live in the city to this very day under the name Franky. When he hears this, Iceburg's pulse greatly quickens and Lucci concludes that he was right.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Water 7 Arc.txt", "title": "Water 7 Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 322 to 374"}}
