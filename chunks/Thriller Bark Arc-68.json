{"content": "- After defeating Ryuma, Zoro gets Shusui to replace the sword he lost back in the Enies Lobby Arc. Later around the end of the Punk Hazard Arc, it was revealed by Kin'emon that Ryuma's grave was robbed, and it causes him to believe Zoro is the culprit, to which he plans to take the sword back from him so it could be returned to Wano Country. The matter was eventually resolved in the Wano Country Arc, when Zoro agreed to returning Shusui to Wano Country in exchange for the sword Enma as Shusui's replacement.\n- Perona having been sent to Kuraigana Island would foreshadow Zoro being sent there by Kuma the following arc, resulting in them having to get along for the next two years while he trains there.\n- Some information of Moria's past is explained:\n\t- At least more than 10 years before the start of the series, Moria fought on par with Kaidou of the Four Emperors.\n\t- Moria was defeated, and in the process, his entire crew was killed presumably by Kaidou.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Thriller Bark Arc.txt", "title": "Thriller Bark Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 442 to 489"}}
