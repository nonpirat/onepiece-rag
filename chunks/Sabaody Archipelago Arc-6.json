{"content": "The Straw Hats recognize the voice and shape of the octopus Fish-Man and Sanji tricks him to talk about Arlong and his crew, revealing to the crew that Camie's friend Hatchan is really their former enemy, Hatchan of the Arlong Pirates. Camie is excited that they know him, but Zoro states that they are not his friends and Nami is considering turning away. This makes Camie sad and Pappag angry at the Straw Hats, so they both jump into the sea only to be immediately captured by the Macro Pirates.\n\nFortunately, Nami convinces the other Straw Hats to save Camie and Pappag since after all, Camie and Pappag are their friends. Duval orders the Flying Fish Riders to attack whilst Luffy rescues Camie and Pappag using his Devil Fruit abilities and orders Zoro to free Hatchan and the rest of the Straw Hats to battle.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
