Boa Hancock is also briefly mentioned but will not be fully revealed until the Amazon Lily Arc.\n- Amongst Moria's zombie army is a pirate named Captain John, which so happens to be the former owner of a treasure that Buggy just so happens to be after. After collecting the treasure on Thriller Bark, Luffy begins wearing a bracelet which he gives to Buggy in the Impel Down Arc which Buggy reveals the bracelet to be a lead to Captain John's treasure.\n\t- Like the first mentions of Kaidou and Big Mom in this arc, John would likewise be associated with an even more infamous pirate crew alongside them.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Thriller Bark Arc.txt", "title": "Thriller Bark Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 442 to 489"}}
