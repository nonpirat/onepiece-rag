{"content": "- Unbeknown to Luffy, he displays for the first time a mysterious power against Duval's bison, Motobaro, the same kind of power showed by Shanks and again by Rayleigh. This is later revealed in the Amazon Lily Arc to be a type of Haki called Haoshoku Haki. Sentomaru also shows an ability to strike and hurt Luffy despite his rubber body. Rayleigh is capable of fighting Kizaru with this type of Haki despite Kizaru's Logia ability. This is also revealed in the Post-War Arc as Busoshoku Haki.\n\t- The application of Busoshoku Haki used with Sentomaru's Ashigara Dokkoi technique and Rayleigh's ability to destroy a collar would later be confirmed in the Wano Country Arc to be a form of advanced Busoshoku Haki.\n- At the same time as the Straw Hat Pirates arrived on Sabaody Archipelago, nine other rookie pirates whose bounties exceed 100,000,000 arrived also, known as the Eleven Supernovas, of which Luffy and Zoro are a part of. These character's roles become more important in later arcs.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
