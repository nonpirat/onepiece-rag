Just before Luffy can insert the key into Ace's cuffs, Kizaru fires a beam of light, breaking the key in two. One of the fallen guards beside Ace rises, revealing himself to be a disguised Mr. 3. Luffy asks Mr. 3 to protect Ace with his wax as he holds Sengoku back with a Gomu Gomu no Gigant Fusen as Sengoku unleashes an enormous punch on Luffy.
