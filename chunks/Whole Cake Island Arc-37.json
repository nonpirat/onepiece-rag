{"content": "In the Room of Treasure, Brook was overwhelmed by Big Mom's power, but refused to go down. Eventually, he was defeated, and after not finding any copies of the Poneglyphs on him, Big Mom decided to keep him as a pet. Although Brook could not overpower her homies Zeus, Prometheus, and Napoleon due to them being made from her own soul, he was capable of giving Prometheus a small wound. Pudding then entered the room and asked to speak with Big Mom. Pudding and Big Mom went over the plan to assassinate the Vinsmokes in the throne room, with Brook overhearing it. In the Mirro-World, Nami, Chopper, Jinbe, Pedro, and Carrot, along with Br\u00fbl\u00e9e and Diesel, searched for Brook, and they eventually found Big Mom sleeping with him. After multiple attempts and barely escaping Big Mom's power, they successfully rescued Brook and brought him back to the Mirro-World. There, Brook revealed that he had copied all of the Poneglyphs and stored them in his skull, and the team celebrated before going to look for Luffy and Sanji.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Whole Cake Island Arc.txt", "title": "Whole Cake Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 825 to 902"}}
