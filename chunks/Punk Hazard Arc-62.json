Both Caesar's and Smoker's men panic and try to get out of the way of the raining slime. Caesar suddenly appears, gloating that the slime will take care of all of them.

Caesar continues to gloat but as he starts to explain himself, Luffy suddenly tackles him.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
