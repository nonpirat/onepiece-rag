{"content": "The citizens all begin to go into an uproar over the supposed mermaid kidnapping. Chopper begs Sanji not to turn around or he will surely die. However, seeing the Mermaid Princess is one of his dreams and that he would rather die fulfilling it. Sanji turns around anyway and instantly turns to stone upon seeing Shirahoshi instead of having a nosebleed. Chopper states that it must be some kind of new symptom possibly due to the okama blood transfer. The citizens suddenly pounce on the group and tie up Luffy, Chopper, Sanji, and Hatchan, coming to the defense of Shirahoshi. Hatchan was tied up since one of the fish-men recognizes him as a former member of Arlong's crew. While they're celebrating and preparing to behead the group despite Shirahoshi's pleas that they were not kidnapping her, Luffy spots an object flying towards them.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
