{"content": "Saturn then orders the Pacifista to stop their attacks, just when a magic circle appears to be forming on the ground in the middle of the Fabriophase, as all Marines are informed that Saturn has arrived on Egghead, leaving everyone in total shock of the presence of one of the Five Elders. An order is then given to all lower-ranking officers, commodores and below, to not directly look at Saturn as he appears out of the circle, having transformed into a large demonic spider hybrid: as one of the Marine soldiers accidentally looks at him, Saturn makes his head telekinetically exploding. Due to Saturn's arrival, Sanji's group got distracted, which then gave Kizaru an opening to destroy the cloud road they were riding on which causes them to fall. Luffy then catches up to Kizaru and uses Gomu Gomu no Star Gun, hitting him in the side of his head. However, Luffy also reached his form's limit, changing back to normal as he fell to the ground in a nearly unconscious state. In addition, the Vegaforce-08 also falls on", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
