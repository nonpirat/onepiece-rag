{"content": "In present time, Spacey continues to cry in regret of his loss, but then bears witness as Enel destroys the excavation site and defeats the Space Pirates with incredible ease. As Enel cleans out his ear, Spacey approaches him while carrying his comrades on a cart and expresses his gratitude for avenging their creator. Unmoved and annoyed, Enel zaps them all again. He then sees a cave within the crater that the Space Pirates were digging and decides to enter. He then discovers an ancient hidden city beneath the moon's crust. In childish spite, Enel then attacks the city with his powers, but the electricity instead recharges it as well as with several ancient automata standing powerless within it.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Enel's Great Space Operations.txt", "title": "Enel's Great Space Operations", "Chapters": "Chapters 428 to 474"}}
