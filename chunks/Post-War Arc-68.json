{"content": "Meanwhile, Capone Bege and his crew find their ship suddenly lifted from the ocean into the air by some mysterious force coming from the sky. Luffy is returning from Marineford and is on the Kuja ship and currently resting (while also being poked and prodded by the Kuja again along with Rayleigh and Jinbe). Luffy hopes the message will reach his crew. Rayleigh responds that it should if they understand its meaning. The rest of the Straw Hats seem to get it (except for Zoro, who has trouble understanding it).\n\nWe then go to the island where Brownbeard took over, and he finds himself meeting Basil Hawkins. After learning his name and reading his fortune, Hawkins proclaims he does not like jokes (finding Brownbeard's name as such) and, while unsheathing his sword, that the shadow of death on the pirate was visible as he activated his ability.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
