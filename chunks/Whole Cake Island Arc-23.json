{"content": "Back in the Seducing Woods, Luffy's fight against Cracker lasted for eleven hours. With the protection of her enslaved homies, Nami created rain clouds to soften Cracker's Biscuit Soldiers, allowing Luffy to eat them. After eating the soldiers, Luffy ran away before coming back and repeating this over and over. Luffy's body was so full it threatened to burst, but his efforts managed to fatigue Cracker. Eventually, after Luffy continued eating even more Biscuit Soldiers, Cracker snapped and charged in to finish Luffy off himself. However, Luffy then activated a form of Gear 4 known as Tankman: Manpuku Version, and he absorbed Cracker into his body before shooting him out, sending him crashing through his Biscuit Soldiers and the trees all the way to Sweet City, where he was discovered by his siblings Opera, Mont-d'Or, and Galette. Shocked by his defeat, they raised a state of emergency in the city. Pound, who had run away during the battle, returned and warned Luffy that Big Mom's wrath would be unleashed", "metadata": {"source": "database/Whole Cake Island Arc.txt", "title": "Whole Cake Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 825 to 902"}}
