{"content": "Meanwhile, Zoro walked through the region of Kibi with a taikomochi named Tonoyasu. Tonoyasu was enamored with him and stuck along after Zoro had saved him from some yakuza thugs. The two of them headed toward Ebisu Town, which was where Tonoyasu originated. At Ebisu Town, Zoro met its citizens, who all laughed constantly and refused to let their extreme poverty and hunger bring them down.\n\nRobin, Nami, Brook, and Shinobu escaped from Orochi Castle, and after dropping Toko off in the Red-Light District went with Kanjuro to the Northern Cemetery in Ringo. There, they talked about Kyoshiro's actions, and Kanjuro wondered what to make of him, as in his time Wano's top yakuza boss was a man named Hyogoro of the Flower. Brook revealed that there was a Poneglyph in the basement of Orochi Castle, but it was not the Road Poneglyph, which was likely on Onigashima. Nami, Robin, and Shinobu then headed back to the Flower Capital to go to a bathhouse.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
