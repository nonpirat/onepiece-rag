{"content": "As this happened, Bellamy had approached Luffy to carry out his assassination mission, only to be confronted by Dellinger, who revealed that Doflamingo believed he would fail again and so ordered him to be killed. Dellinger severely injured Bellamy, but was stopped by Bartolomeo, and forced to go with Lao G to the SMILE Factory. Bartolomeo said he would not let a comrade die without helping, and Luffy came running in looking for an exit. Bellamy said there was none and wished to leave as well to meet with Doflamingo. Bartolomeo agreed to win the Mera Mera no Mi for Luffy, but a mysterious man said he could not let that happen as he approached the three. Luffy recognized the man as his long-lost brother Sabo, who was now the second in command of the Revolutionary Army, and Sabo gave Luffy an escape route. Luffy cried nonstop as he, Zoro and Kin'emon headed for the palace in animal disguises, and inside the Colosseum, Sabo donned Luffy's Lucy disguise as he contacted Koala, who was also in the Revolutionaries,", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
