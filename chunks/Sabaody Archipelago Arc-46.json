{"content": "Kid offers to take care of the Marines while the others escape. However, Luffy and Law seem to take it as an insult and join him in battle. The Straw Hats ready themselves for a fight and the giant slave from before offers to get the other slaves out while they thank the Straw Hats for freeing them. Back outside, the Marines open fire with mortars but Luffy and Kid reflect them back, with Luffy doing so using his Gomu Gomu no Fusen move, and the latter repelling it using only his hand to do so. Law meanwhile covers an area with a spherical barrier using his ability and cuts off one of the Marines' heads within the sphere, though the action does not kill him. Instead, he replaces it with a cannonball that promptly explodes hitting those that were near his decapitated body while Law holds the Marine's head in his hand. It now becomes clear that the two other Captains alongside Luffy are no mere pirates and the Marines realize that they are dealing with Devil Fruit users.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
