Saturn soon appeared out of the rubble and asked if Vegapunk was responsible, and Vegapunk responded that it could be either him or just the power of love. Saturn then regenerated his limbs and tried to attack Kuma again, but Sanji kicked Saturn's leg back, followed by Franky using Radical Beam. Kizaru swiftly appeared behind Franky and proceeded to blast him away. As Kuma could not move, Vegapunk told Atlas to carry him over to the Labophase. Kizaru considered that now with the presence of Kuma, the mission had to be wrapped up.
