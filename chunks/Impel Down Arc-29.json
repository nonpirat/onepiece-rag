{"content": "Outside, Boa Hancock and Momonga have left the prison and are heading back to their Marine ship via a ferry. Twenty-nine hours remain before Ace's execution. As she looks on at the prison, Hancock prays for Luffy's safety. The two eventually reach the ship where Momonga receives urgent news, Kaidou, one of the Four Emperors, took off to try and take down Whitebeard, but Shanks intercepted him and the two are currently in a dispute. This news unnerves Momonga as he knows what could happen if two Emperors fight, not to mention the coming threat of Whitebeard on top of everything. He quickly has his ship sail off for Marineford.\n\nBack inside the prison, Buggy and Mr. 3 get into an argument with Luffy and Bon over escaping rather than heading further into Impel Down. Before they can continue however, part of the floor they are on breaks off (due to the strength of their attacks which causes the four to get into an argument over whose was more powerful) and sends them plummeting to Level 4.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
