{"content": "The Marines, upon hearing the story, became frightened. The Vice Admiral tells the Marines that as long as that man is here assisting in the recapture of Nico Robin, they do not need to act, and will do nothing until all but the Bridge of Hesitation is destroyed. In the tunnels, Zoro, Sanji and Sogeking heard the sound of water, and see Nami, Kokoro (with Chopper on her hat), Chimney, and Gonbe running away from the rushing water. The water began to fill up the passage, engulfing them all.\n\nLucci, after receiving a Gear 3 attack, is knocked out, and landed on one of the Marine's ships. After recovering, Lucci returns to human form and takes off his shirt, showing scars on his back similar to the World Government's symbol. Luffy inhaled deeply and then attacked the ship. The Marines fired at him, but Luffy was unaffected.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Enies Lobby Arc.txt", "title": "Enies Lobby Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 375 to 430"}}
