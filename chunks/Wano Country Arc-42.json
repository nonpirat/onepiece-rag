{"content": "Raizo had to leave Kawamatsu after being spotted, and Queen put Luffy and Hyogoro into a sumo ring. He had special collars affixed to their necks, saying that if they were forced out of the ring, the collars would go off and decapitate them. To decrease their disadvantage, he had Luffy's handcuffs removed, much to Raizo's bewilderment. A group of Waiters then charged into the ring, but Luffy quickly knocked all of them out with his Haoshoku Haki. He then easily beat the Pleasures, and tried to hit them by projecting Haki from his palm like he had seen Rayleigh do, but was unsuccessful. The Gifters Alpacaman and Madilloman entered the ring, and Luffy used his advanced Kenbunshoku Haki to help Hyo avoid their attacks, but continued to fail at advancing his Busoshoku Haki. Hyogoro eventually recognized what he was trying to do, revealing that people from Wano know it as Ryuo. He then ran up toward Alpacaman and hit him with a burst of projected Haki, and offered to train Luffy in its usage.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
