{"content": "Wapol's Omnivorous Hurrah, Chapters 236 to 262, Volumes 25 to 28.\n\n\nLong Summary\n\n\nOn an unknown island, the landscape had been marred, as if someone had took huge bites out of it. That person is revealed to be Wapol, who landed there after being sent flying by Luffy from Drum Island and regained his original figure after eating so much. He surprises a local man by sporting a tree head after eating one. Then he eats a gas lamp, annoying the nocturnal animals at night, and then a bench, scaring away unsuspecting people trying to sit on him. Finally, Wapol snaps and starts eating an entire town for dessert, which results in his arrest by the Marines.\n\nMeanwhile, back on Drum Island, Dalton becomes the new king, with the kingdom being renamed as the Sakura Kingdom.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wapol's Omnivorous Hurrah.txt", "title": "Wapol's Omnivorous Hurrah", "Chapters": "Chapters 236 to 262"}}
