{"content": "Orochi transformed into the Yamata no Orochi and tried to avoid attacking her, but his anger eventually overcame his attraction, and he wrested her into his mouth. Meanwhile, the Orochi Oniwabanshu spotted Robin running away with Toko and chased her, although she managed to overpower them with Brook's help. One of the Oniwabanshu, Hanzo, crawled into the attic and discovered Nami and Shinobu hiding out there. Shinobu incapacitated him before destroying the floor, sending it crashing down onto Orochi below and freeing Komurasaki from his grasp. The oiran then stood in front of Kyoshiro and let him strike her down in order to give her a samurai's mercy. Orochi was distraught to see Komurasaki be killed, and he started chasing after Robin and Toko. However, Nami summoned Zeus and brought him down onto the shogun, striking him with a massive thunderbolt.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
