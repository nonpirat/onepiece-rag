{"content": "Luffy quickly takes advantage of the situation and runs for it, though the Blugori set after him, only to be felled by Luffy's Gomu Gomu no Gatling. He notices Buggy and Mr. 3 climbing the net onto a rafter of the level. The two mock Luffy but he just shouts his thanks for their help much to their bewilderment. Saldeath rallies his security force to go after Luffy forcing him to fight a few until the Sphinx recovers and comes after him as well. Seeing this, Luffy hops across the guard's heads and runs down the hall with security forces in pursuit. Buggy and Mr. 3 take their time to rest for the moment as they try to figure out a way back to Level 2. The two suddenly hear singing coming from a cell whose voice Mr. 3 recognizes. The two follow it leading to a cell containing none other than Bon Kurei who is doing ballet with the prisoners in his cell (though they collapse shortly after). As he spins, he does a double take once he sees Mr. 3 who asks Buggy if they could not let him out, while Buggy himself is", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
