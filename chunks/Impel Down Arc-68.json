{"content": "The security force reaches Level 6 with gas masks on, prepared to fight against the Devil Fruit users. However, once they get past the gate, they find a spiral shaped stairway leading to a hole in the ceiling. Shiryu calls out to the guards informing them (between mocking) that the trio has released Crocodile and Jinbe, and with their help have escaped the level. Shiryu tells the guards to go tell Magellan that he'd be willing to help him. In the Monitor Room, news of this new development has reached Hannyabal, who decides to deal with things himself and have all the Impel Down forces meet on Level 4. Back on Level 5, Iva and Inazuma have gathered the residents of Newkama Land. They tell them to cause a riot throughout all of Impel Down, grabbing keys and unlocking cages as they go to keep the security forces occupied. Iva calls out for Luffy to proceed only to be informed by Inazuma that he, along with Crocodile and Jinbe, have already pressed on. Iva shrugs this off and tells the others to follow after", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
