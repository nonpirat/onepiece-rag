{"content": "On Punk Hazard, Law begins setting their counterattack into motion. He asks Franky to burn a nearby ship to creating a smokescreen, then reveals that he had swapped some of the Seastone chains in the laboratory with normal ones, allowing him to break free. He switches Smoker and Tashigi back into their original bodies, demanding their cooperation in return for their lives. Tashigi, embarrassed as her top is unbuttoned, quickly agrees which Smoker admonishes her for begging. Tashigi retorts that some things are more important than pride while also commenting on the consequences if they were to die there. Seeing no choice, Smoker reluctantly agrees to the condition. Law teleports his group into the lab and opens the shutter door to let the G-5 Marines enter the facility much to the shock of Caesar's underlings who find the captured prisoners now freed.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
