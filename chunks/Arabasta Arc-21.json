{"content": "Miss All Sunday is confronted by Marines led by Tashigi. Having a more than personal enmity against Marines than other pirates, she yells at them to get out of her way. Tashigi demands she releases Cobra, but Miss All Sunday is not prepared to take orders from those who directly take orders from the World Government. Tashigi is later informed by one of her men that Miss All Sunday was originally known as \"Nico Robin\", who received a bounty of 79,000,000 as a child because she was believed to have been responsible for the sinking of six warships.\n\nVisibly angered, Miss All Sunday easily dispatches the Marine grunts, and defeats Tashigi with her Devil Fruit ability. As Tashigi struggles for her sword, Crocodile appears, calling her superior Smoker \"cowardly\" and mocking her and the Marines' ideals of \"Justice\" before departing again. Tashigi is left crying confused as to what action she should take, and angry she is not strong enough.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Arabasta Arc.txt", "title": "Arabasta Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 155 to 217"}}
