{"content": "Reverse Mountain Arc(Chapters 101 to 105, Volume 12)\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nAs the Straw Hats sail through a storm, Nami realizes that they will be going up Reverse Mountain to access the Grand Line. The crew expresses disbelief at the idea, with Zoro wondering why they can't just go south. Suddenly, the storm stops, and Nami reveals that they are in the Calm Belt, one of two strips of ocean surrounding the Grand Line, where there are no winds or currents. Nami urges the crew to row back to the storm, but the Sea Kings infesting the water then rise up. The Straw Hats struggle to get away, and once they escape, they turn their attention to successfully riding the dangerous current up Reverse Mountain. Their rudder soon breaks, but Luffy shields the Going Merry from hitting the mountain as the Straw Hats successfully sail down into the Grand Line.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Reverse Mountain Arc.txt", "title": "Reverse Mountain Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 101 to 105"}}
