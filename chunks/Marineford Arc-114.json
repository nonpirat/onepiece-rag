{"content": "- As revealed in the Dressrosa Arc, Ace's death would have an effect on Sabo who unknown to both Ace and Luffy at the time was still alive. As a result, this helps Sabo recover his memories after being stricken with amnesia for ten years. It is also the reason why he is so determined to protect Luffy so he would not have to lose another \"sworn brother\".\n\t- After Ace dies, Whitebeard predicts that someone will \"come to inherit his will.\" This prediction later comes true as Sabo eats Ace's Devil Fruit after he dies and specifically voices his desire to inherit the late pirate's will, mirroring Whitebeard's prediction exactly.\n- Marshall D. Teach is revealed to have recruited five new members into his crew from Level 6 of Impel Down: Sanjuan Wolf, Catarina Devon, Vasco Shot, Avalo Pizarro and Shiryu.\n- The entire Blackbeard crew (except Sanjuan Wolf) attacks and kills Whitebeard.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
