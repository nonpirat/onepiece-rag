{"content": "- The entire Straw Hat crew are now considered a threat to the World Government due to their declaration of war, and everyone now has bounties. Zoro joins Luffy as a Supernova as his bounty is doubled, and Luffy's bounty is tripled, placing his in the realm of the former bounties of the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Robin's bounty is raised minimally mainly as a means to get her picture updated, Usopp's poster has him listed under his alias Sogeking. Even Chopper gets a bounty, although it is tiny as he is mistaken for a pet. Sanji never had his picture taken, and the artist's rendering looks nothing like him. This consistency continues even when Franky joins the crew; he also earned a bounty for his actions.\n- At the end of this arc, the Going Merry finally reaches her absolute limit, and is given a Viking funeral. This forced the Straw Hat Pirates to get a new ship, which turned out to be the Thousand Sunny, made by Franky.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Enies Lobby Arc.txt", "title": "Enies Lobby Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 375 to 430"}}
