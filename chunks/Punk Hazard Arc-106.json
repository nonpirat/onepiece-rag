{"content": "As Mocha continues to run from the berserk children, she has a flashback to Caesar lying to her and the kids' parents about their \"illness\" and how he had a son who also died from it, which is why Caesar wanted to heal the children. As she remembers her friend, Mocha pleads to the berserk children to go back to their normal dispositions.\n\nMeanwhile in the Biscuits Room, Monet attempts to attack Nami and Chopper, but Zoro blocks her attack and Nami responds with a Heat Egg, damaging Monet. Robin, Nami and Chopper attempt to stop the children again, but Monet blocks the exit out of the Biscuits Room with a snow barrier. Monet then transforms into a terrifying, demonic like snow woman, capturing Chopper and Nami in her body and nearly biting into the two. Robin uses her Hana Hana no Mi abilities to make arms on Nami's hips and shatters Monet apart.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
