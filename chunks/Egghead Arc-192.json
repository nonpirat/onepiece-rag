With the vice admirals puzzled on how to stop the Pacifista without destroying them, they went on trying to kill Bonney so the Pacifista would be back on their side. Vice admiral Tosa reported he was going after Bonney's group and tried to kill her, but he was taken down by Brogy. Brogy and Dorry introduced themselves to the group as allies of the Straw Hats and have come to save them and their friends. Bonney asked for them to help Luffy, Sanji, and Vegapunk, who were still at the center of the island, which they accepted while the rest of the Giant Warrior Pirates escorted the group to the northeast coast.

When asked by Bluegrass if she fought a giant before, Doll answered that she once served under a giant over 20", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
