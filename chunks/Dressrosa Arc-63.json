{"content": "In the palace, Pica abandoned his fight with Zoro. In the throne room, after returning to his human form, Kyros charged at Doflamingo as Doldo and Viola regained their memories of him. Kyros then decapitated Doflamingo as Luffy raced in to rescue Law. As Kyros took out several of Doflamingo's men including Buffalo and freed Doldo, Luffy worked to free Law from his Seastone handcuffs. However, Pica then arrived, and Doflamingo was revealed to still be alive as he stated that he would have to use the \"Birdcage.\" As Kyros attacked him, the real Doflamingo swooped in to kill him, but Luffy pulled him out of harm's way. Luffy fought the two Doflamingos but was overpowered, with the decapitated Doflamingo being revealed to be a string clone. On Doflamingo's command, Pica forced Luffy, Law, Kyros, Viola, and Doldo outside as Doflamingo's string clone transformed into a cage of strings that surrounded the entire island.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
