{"content": "Ivankov mentions that there was once another Head Jailer known as \"Shiryu of the Rain\" who was even more dangerous than Magellan himself. Together the two made Impel Down near impenetrable, however Shiryu killed prisoners for no reason other than his own pleasure. Thus, he was labeled a menace and was locked away on Level 6. Iva lists off a few other names of prisoners who the World Government have covered up, not even allowed to be mentioned in newspapers. He also mentions Crocodile, Jinbe, and of course Ace and his relation to Luffy. However, Iva notes that it is now midnight meaning the date of Ace's execution is at hand and since Luffy's treatment will take another two days it'll be too late by then to save him. This news disheartens Bon who decides to stay with Luffy for the rest of the treatment. Upon hearing Luffy's continued screaming, Bon starts to shout out encouragements to him. This touches the others, and they join him.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
