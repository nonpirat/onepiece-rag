{"content": "As Luffy bounced around trying to think of a name for his new attack, Kaidou asked the Straw Hat captain who he was, which the sun god in turn affirmed that he was Monkey D. Luffy, the future Pirate King. Kaidou then explained about the Devil Fruit's awakening, before commenting about everything he lost in this war, though Luffy in turn stated that he was going to take everything that Kaidou had taken back. The Emperor responded by attacking with Gundari Ryuseigun, with Luffy taking all the hits, before responding with a barrage of punches of his own which warped Kaidou's body as well. Luffy then noticed the smoke from the flames below, with Kaidou mentioning how Luffy's allies would all be burnt to death within his burning castle, the Straw Hat captain simply stated that he could leave everything to his crew so all he had to do was concentrate on defeating his opponent. In response Kaidou released a Kaifu which Luffy dodged.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
