{"content": "In a flashback, Luffy says his goodbyes to the Kuja Pirates. Hancock suggests that Luffy wear a hood to conceal his identity, as she knows the Marines are still looking for him even after two years. She also gives him an overpacked sack of clothes and goodies, much to Nyon's annoyance. Luffy then bids farewell to Hancock and the Kujas, promising they'll meet again (though Hancock takes it as another proposal). Back in the present day, Fake Luffy is threatening Luffy with his pistol and trying to get Luffy to fear him. The rest of Fake Luffy's crew join in to intimidate Luffy, with the crowd hoping he will go along with their wishes. However, Luffy simply brushes them off and turns to leave. Fake Luffy goes to shoot him, but Luffy manages to dodge the bullet at point blank range and then uses Haoshoku Haki on the Fake Straw Hats causing them to faint, which astonishes the crowd.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Return to Sabaody Arc.txt", "title": "Return to Sabaody Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 598 to 602"}}
