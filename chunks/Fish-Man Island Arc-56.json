{"content": "Hody shows his disappointment and states that he has lost all hope in Hatchan. Decken then touches Hatchan, saying that he is locked onto him. Decken then demonstrates his power by throwing a knife over Hatchan. It suddenly flies into the octopus, stabbing him in the back. Decken explains that as long as a person remains his target after touching them, what he throws will always fly towards them. He then takes some arrows from a nearby pirate. Hatchan, realizing what he is about to do, yells at Hody to call him off, but Hody dismisses Hatchan as too weak and allows Decken to throw the arrows. Hatchan runs for his life and dives into the ocean, but it does him little good, and he gets struck by the arrows.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
