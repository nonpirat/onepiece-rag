{"content": "Jinbe tells Luffy to stop beating himself up over Ace's actions, but Luffy refuses and tries to punch him but misses. Jinbe then pins Luffy to the ground where Luffy bites him, and Jinbe finally gets mad at Luffy and pins him to a rock. There he says that right now his thoughts and path are over-shadowed by grief, but someday he will find something he will never stop fighting for. At that point, he lets Luffy go, and Luffy takes a while to think. When he finally reaches his answer, his face is drowned in tears and he admits that he still has his loyal and faithful crew and that he wants to go back to them as soon as possible, no matter what.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
