{"content": "The crew enter the city, which still exhibits the remains of the destruction caused during the events of the Dressrosa Arc, including the ground scarred by Doflamingo's Torikago. Disguised, they started looking and asking for Lola among the citizens, with Bege finding two women whose backsides are similar to Chiffon and Lola's. Suddenly, Vito finds several men collapsed to the ground with kiss marks on them due to a vacuum-kissing spree by Kyuin. The reason for this is because the Germ Pirates, who chose to attack Dressrosa while King Riku was away, were causing chaos by spreading their \"Kiss-Kiss Germ\" among the citizens. Fortunately, Bege and Vito defeat them easily, but only to keep them from attracting unwanted attention from the Marines.", "metadata": {"source": "database/\"Gang\" Bege's Oh My Family.txt", "title": "\"Gang\" Bege's Oh My Family", "Chapters": "Chapters 948 to 994"}}
