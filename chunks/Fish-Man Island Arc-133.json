{"content": "The real Robin shows herself and tells the three they are all friends after all. After everyone calms down, Jinbe tries to talk some sense into Luffy, explaining that every time they tried to get along with humans, humans would always reject them leading the fish-men to believe that all humans hate them. Even the Arlong incident made them think he was taken down just because he was a fish-man. So, if Luffy tries to battle Hody it will just be viewed as more human oppression to someone trying to end it. Sanji counters however that if they left now, Fish-Man Island would be under Hody's rule and as they have friends on the island, they cannot just turn a blind eye. Sanji also asks Hatchan that when he pleaded for them to leave, it was because Hody attacked him for sympathizing with humans which Hatchan is reluctant to answer. Sanji concludes that it's because it's their country that Luffy does have more of a reason to fight other than just saving his crew. Luffy demands at Jinbe to get out of the way once more", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
