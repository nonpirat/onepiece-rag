{"content": "Luffy eventually has enough of his foolishness, going into Gear 2 and hits him with Gomu Gomu no Jet Gatling. Surprisingly, Hannyabal, though heavily wounded, gets back up and continues the fight. It's at this point that Magellan arrives on Level 4 though at the far end from where the riot is and will still take a while before he arrives at the fight. Meanwhile, Luffy keeps hitting Hannyabal with a variety of attacks and tries to move on, but the Vice Warden refuses to stay down. His troops begin to worry about him begging him not to push himself so hard. Hannyabal goes into a tirade about how evil pirates are and how they cause fear to the citizens above. He proclaims that Impel Down is a prison to keep evil pirates away from said people and that if it falls it'll plunge the world into darkness. Luffy however counters that Ace is precious to him and for Hannyabal to move out of his way, prompting the Vice Warden to state that \"some fools just refuse to listen.\"", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
