{"content": "On Level 4 in an area known as the \"Lake of Blood\", inmates are forced into the cauldron Bon previously described while a few are made to bring firewood to keep it heated. One prisoner tries to escape but runs right into Daz Bonez who headbutts him into the cauldron. Meanwhile in a passageway that connects Levels 3 and 4, Magellan has gathered the guards and Impel Down staff to intercept Luffy's group. It's here we're introduced to the rest of the Jailer Beasts: Minorhinoceros, Minokoala, and Minozebra (all of whom, like Minotarus, do not look as threatening as their name suggests) who Sadi is in charge of commenting that they're growing restless and thirsting for blood.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
