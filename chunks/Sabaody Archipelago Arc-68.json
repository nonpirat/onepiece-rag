{"content": "Meanwhile, all the Straw Hats work together to bring down the Kuma clone; Zoro, who was still hurt from his wounds on Thriller Bark, struggles to stand up and Sanji tells Luffy to first bring down the clone before tending to Zoro's injuries, though the former notes that Zoro is still suffering from the aftermath of the events that occurred in Thriller Bark. Chopper uses Cloven Roseo Metel on Kuma, enraging him and causing him to try and blast Chopper only for Franky to nail him with his Strong Hammer. Kuma easily sends Franky flying, but Franky is saved by Robin, who uses her Spider Net to catch him. Brook tries to attack him from above only for Kuma to try and blast him, but he is saved by Usopp when he uses Atlas Suisei to distract Kuma.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
