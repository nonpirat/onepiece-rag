{"content": "He makes a deal with Luffy; he will escort him to Level 4 of Impel Down, but in return Luffy has to give him the arm band. Without hesitation, Luffy agrees. Buggy tells Luffy to pick his feet up, explaining that so long as his feet are on solid ground, or touching something on the ground, such as Luffy, he could fly within a set range. After Buggy mistakenly reveals the truth behind the armband, Luffy decides to give him the arm band in advance for helping him. Buggy feels guilty for lying to Luffy, but he decides nonetheless to escape from Luffy. Before Buggy can make good on his escape, he flies into a wall backwards. Luffy mistakes this as a shortcut through the wall and crashes into the Jailer's room and towards Crimson Hell, the first level of Impel Down, which is a forest that has blade like leaves and grass. Prisoners are made to run through such a place while being chased by poisonous spiders, dyeing the forest red with blood due to cuts, hence the title of the level.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
