{"content": "Magellan recognizes the wall made of wax which Mr. 3 gloats is tough as steel and enough to block his attacks. Even Crocodile is impressed as is Luffy. Luffy has Jinbe go on ahead to secure a ship while he stays with Mr. 3 to hold off Magellan so he will not attack while they are trying to secure a boat. He also mentions he has an idea on how to fight the Chief Warden. Jinbe agrees and hurries on ahead with a few of the prisoners. Mr. 3 of course wants nothing to do with fighting Magellan explaining he can only defend, though the prisoners that stayed are giving him encouragement. Mr. 3 then fits Luffy hands and feet with wax boxing gloves and shoes (similar to his Candle Champion Technique), much to Luffy's amazement and gratitude though Mr. 3 shouts at him to focus on Magellan. The Chief Warden comes at them with another Hydra, forcing Mr. 3 to create another Candle Wall. Luffy jumps out and hits Magellan with a Gomu Gomu no Champion Rifle. The attack knocks Magellan back with no effect on Luffy,", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
