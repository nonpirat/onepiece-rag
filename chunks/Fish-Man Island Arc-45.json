Luffy spots it in time and manages to knock it away, saving Shirahoshi. The guards and the Minister of the Right enter the room a moment later. Shirahoshi grabs Luffy and hides him behind her back, telling the guards that she just had a bad dream. They accept the explanation before telling the princess of the suspicions toward the Straw Hats due to the mermaid disappearances and Madame Shyarly's vision of Luffy destroying Fish-Man Island.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
