{"content": "As Luffy continues to battle Marine soldiers, Smoker bursts towards him, intent on settling the score. Smoker manages to strike Luffy with his Seastone jitte, dealing more damage than Luffy would usually take. Luffy strikes back with Gomu Gomu no Jet Gatling, but the attacks slip right through Smoker's smoke. As Smoker and Luffy comment on how the other has grown stronger, the former pins the latter to the ground with his jitte.\n\nSmoker muses on how he finally understands why Dragon saved Luffy back at Loguetown, while Luffy struggles to free himself from Smoker's restraint. Hancock suddenly kicks Smoker away, her Haki allowing her to make contact with Smoker. When Smoker asks why Hancock is not fulfilling her duty as a Warlord, Hancock ignores the question. She states that she has never felt as angry as she has in her life and that she would not let anyone harm her beloved Luffy. Luffy shows gratitude for Hancock's assistance.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
