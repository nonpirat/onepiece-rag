{"content": "Franky picks him up with one hand, with Caribou begging him not to throw him out into the ocean. Franky, instead, simply throws him against one of the side rails of the ship. Caribou immediately denies he was the captain of the crew, saying he is just a human bullet for that crew and that he is sick of being on that ship. He then asks the Straw Hats if it would be alright if he rode with them for a while. The Straw Hats allow it but keep him bound with a rope. The scene momentarily switches back to the Caribou Pirates ship, with the crew trying to tell Momoo to stop and asking him what happened. Coribou then says that Caribou will save them for sure.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
