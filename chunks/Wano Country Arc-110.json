{"content": "With Kid's sudden appearance, the Beasts Pirates were surprised while Queen was shocked to learn another one of Babanuki's false report. Kid confronted Apoo about their alliance, with the latter ridiculing Kid's naivety on the concept of a pirate alliance and attacked him. Queen then granted the Beasts Pirates permission to kill the intruders. Hatcha of the Numbers joined the fight, knocking out some of his crew members. Kid was blown away and was about to be attacked, but Luffy saved him out of anger for Kid causing a riot. As the Supernovas tried to get away from the horde of enemies, they were targeted by Apoo, but thanks to Killer's intel about Apoo's powers, managed to avoid being hit by covering their ears. Above the fight, Who's-Who was talking with his men about finding Yamato because he wished to get rid of one of the Tobiroppo, which mirrored Queen's desire.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
