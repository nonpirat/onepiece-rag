{"content": "Meanwhile, Fake Zoro and Fake Sanji chase after the real Chopper, after their Captain makes the realization that it was the real \"pet,\" but run into Luffy (also the real one), whose identity they are still ignorant of. Upon his last run-in and Hancock's suggestion, he finally dons the fake mustache given to him and mistakes the fakes for the real ones, though they question whether he is the \"kid\" they are looking for.\n\nIn Grove 41, the real Zoro states his intention to fish at the beach. The real Sanji responds by yelling at him, explaining they do not have time to search for a \"wayward marimo\" (should Zoro's incredible talent for getting lost remain intact), and that they, together, should head to the ship as everyone will gather there soon. Turning away from Sanji, Zoro complains to himself that #7 thinks he's so high and mighty over #1, with the numbers being a reference to the order the Straw Hats arrived on the archipelago. Sanji, now beyond annoyed by Zoro, starts a fight.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Return to Sabaody Arc.txt", "title": "Return to Sabaody Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 598 to 602"}}
