{"content": "In Grove 47, Fake Zoro and Fake Sanji, along with the real Chopper, have regrouped with the Fake Straw Hats, who are recovering. They report Fake Robin's (whose real name is Cocoa) kidnapping to the Fake Luffy, with Chopper frantically trying to get the group to go after them. Fake Luffy, however, dismisses his crewmate's kidnapping. He orders the bunch to gather up their recruited pirates to track down the real Luffy, Nami, and Usopp, starting from Grove 46. Chopper runs off, unable to believe they would just abandon \"Robin,\" and goes off to try to rescue her himself. Unbeknownst to him and the Fake Straw Hats, some Marines have been monitoring them.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Return to Sabaody Arc.txt", "title": "Return to Sabaody Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 598 to 602"}}
