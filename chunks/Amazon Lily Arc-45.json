{"content": "- After returning to Amazon Lily, Hancock, fearing she would bring shame to her people if they knew about her past as a slave, would lie to her people about her Devil Fruit powers, stating she and her sisters killed a \"Gorgon\" which cursed them and made them gain a pair of Gorgon eyes on their backs to hide the truth about their slave brands and Devil Fruit powers. If the truth would ever be found out, she would be forced to leave the country.\n\t- At age 18, she became empress of her tribe, and after a single campaign, she gained a starter bounty of 80,000,000. The government feared her potential and offered her the position of a Warlord of the Sea. She agreed but on the condition that a treaty would be placed on her people that prevents any and all ships from approaching Amazon Lily. However, in the process, every person living on Amazon Lily is labeled as a pirate. Should her title of a Warlord of the Sea be revoked, the Marines would attack the island.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Amazon Lily Arc.txt", "title": "Amazon Lily Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 514 to 524"}}
