{"content": "Meanwhile, at the Kamabakka Kingdom, Sanji and Iva are having lunch, to which Sanji finds their food very delicious and inquiries about it. Iva tells him it is the \"Attack Cuisine\" food that strengthens the body. Sanji sees the benefits of using such a meal for his crew (mostly thinking about what it could do to Nami and Robin) and asks for the recipes. Iva refuses, however, mentioning that it is part of the secret bridal training, and it cannot just be passed on to a random stranger, though if he were an Okama, he would be willing. Sanji refuses this, stating that he was born to love women, not make friends with them. This resolve impresses Iva and tells Sanji that the recipes are being held by 99 masters of Newkama Kenpo, and if he defeats them, Sanji can take the recipes, though he warns that they, as well as the other Okamas, will try to get him in a dress again. If Sanji endures and wins, Iva will grant his every request. If not, Iva wonders if he will remain a man. Sanji, remembering his first meeting", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
