{"content": "Having told the samurai that his torso was near the lake, Brook and the others head there to look for him. They find him after unknowingly stepping on his body freezing in the snow. After waking him up, the samurai comments that he felt as if his torso had fallen into the water which caused him to freeze up. The three Straw Hats agree to go into the lake to retrieve it. When asked why pirates are going to all the trouble to help him, Sanji comments he just felt it as their responsibility and that when he gets his body back, they will have a fight. Grateful the samurai thanks them before they spot figures coming toward them revealed to be the Centaur Patrol Unit they fought earlier running from something, even ignoring the group in their retreat. Zoro realizes they are running from the direction from the lake but also points out a giant shadow in the distance.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
