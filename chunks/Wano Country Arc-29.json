After eating, Toko raced off to join the oiran Komurasaki, whom she worked for as a kamuro. Robin's master came in and revealed that Komurasaki was the greatest of all oiran in Wano, and that Robin would be accompanying her to Orochi's banquet. As Komurasaki paraded through the street, she left many men incapacitated in her wake, she was attacked by a group of men whom she had swindled after tricking them into giving her money to purchase her freedom. The men were quickly taken out by a guard and exiled, and Komurasaki coldly looked down on them.
