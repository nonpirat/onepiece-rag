He abruptly stops as Usopp and Nami ride by on one of the Archipelago's bubble contraptions, calling to him. Finally reunited on the island, they embrace as long-seen old friends.

Usopp comments that he's already created his own, while Nami adds that", "metadata": {"source": "database/Return to Sabaody Arc.txt", "title": "Return to Sabaody Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 598 to 602"}}
