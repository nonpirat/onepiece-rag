{"content": "Suddenly, a Den Den Mushi from somewhere transmitted a mysterious voice, which also congratulated Luffy. Knowing that they are being heard by everybody, they reveal themselves to be the Franky Family, Galley-La shipwrights, Yokozuna, Oimo and K\u0101sh\u012b, dangling by Paulie's rope. They explain that the giants took all the shots for them, and that they are all safe. All of them begin climbing the rope, as Franky starts crying. Wiping the last of his tears, he yelled defiance at the Marines.\n\nThe Marines then realize that Luffy is seriously fatigued and has not been able to move, much to the crew's shock. Usopp encouraged Luffy again to move, but the latter cannot move at all. The Marines now noticed that the pirates are escaping through the escort ship, fire at it, and destroy the ship. The crew, realizing that Kokoro, Chimney, Gonbe and Chopper are still there, watched in horror as the ship starts sinking.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Enies Lobby Arc.txt", "title": "Enies Lobby Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 375 to 430"}}
