{"content": "On Sphinx, the residents informed Marco that the Marines had invaded looking for Whitebeard's treasure. The Marine captain, Ratel, had threatened to execute them one by one until they would admit where it was. However, Weevil had arrived to defend his father's hometown and fought off the Marines, forcing them to retreat and request backup. Ryokugyu was sent and had subdued and captured Weevil. After the story finished, Miss Buckin, formerly known as Buckingham Stussy, an ex-Rock pirate and a former member of MADS as well, demanded that Marco rescue her son and tell her where Whitebeard's treasure was. Marco thanked her for protecting the island, but she assumed that he doubted her son's lineage and offered to have Vegapunk prove it. In a fleet of Marine and World Government ships making their way to Egghead, Kizaru served tea to Saint Jaygarcia Saturn, one of the Five Elders.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
