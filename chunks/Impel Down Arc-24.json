{"content": "Meanwhile, Luffy is trying to find his way to Level 4 on his own. He runs into guards that fire Seastone nets his way. He manages to dodge them but is suddenly pinned down by the Sphinx. Before the beast can bite into him, a voice catches its attention. The person apparently being Zoro, who proceeds to beat up the Sphinx with his kicks. Luffy however realizes that that's not Zoro's fighting style before the person changes into Bon Kurei, much to Luffy's joy (after some initial disappointment that it wasn't his swordsman). The two team up to beat the guards and take down the Sphinx before tearfully weeping and hugging at being reunited. As Saldeath prepares to send his remaining Blugori after them, Bon Kurei happily agrees to help Luffy reach Level 5 since he wishes to meet someone on that level as well.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
