{"content": "The port town of Nanohana in the desert Kingdom of Arabasta is being invaded by pirates. Crocodile, one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, arrives and quashes the invasion. The townspeople are grateful and praise him as their hero. The news of the event reaches King Nefertari Cobra, and he says that they are indebted to Crocodile.\n\nMeanwhile, the Straw Hats finally reach Nanohana. Luffy, hungry from the long journey, storms off into town without waiting for his crew. At a bar, he interrupts a confrontation between a man named Portgas D. Ace and Captain Smoker of the Marines, knocking both through the wall without his noticing. Luffy grabs a lot of meat but flees when Smoker stands back up and gives chase. He leads the Marines directly to his crew mates that were purchasing provisions and water in the town. Just as Smoker tries to catch them, Ace interrupts and secures an escape route for the Straw Hat Pirates.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Arabasta Arc.txt", "title": "Arabasta Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 155 to 217"}}
