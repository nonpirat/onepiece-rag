{"content": "Luffy's awakening was noticed by others besides Momonosuke, including Sanji, Kid, Law, Hyogoro and Marco, who notified the nearby Nami and Tama about Luffy's survival. When Luffy reached a spot directly above Kaidou, he released a blast of Haoshoku Haki which knocked out a good number of Beasts Pirates, before reaching down with an inflated fist, grabbing Kaidou and then comically pulling him back up. He then inflated his other arm and started swinging Kaidou's around before repeatedly slamming the dragon's head into the ground. Kaidou quickly recovered from his dizziness, thanking Luffy for surviving before releasing a Bolo Breath at him. Though Luffy acted comically shocked, he reacted quickly to the attack, stretching the ground beneath him and bouncing the breath back. Kaidou endured the counterattack, and then apologized for their sabotaged battle, though Luffy didn't take it to heart, instead requesting to finish this battle.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
