{"content": "Luffy follows the scent of food, trying to find the banquet hall. The smell leads him to a door, where a guard is just coming from. Luffy wanders inside, finding the room pitch black but able to see the food on the other side of the room. He heads for it while noticing that the ground is rather odd, especially a rather bouncy section (which he believes to be pudding). However, someone shouts, and the lights turn on, revealing the ground to be a person's body, with the bouncy part being her breasts. The person turns out to be Princess Shirahoshi, a giant smelt-whiting mermaid. She tries to put on a brave face after seeing Luffy, thinking him to be an assassin, before crying out for her father and brothers.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
