However, Yamato earnestly believed that fighting to their last breath would be preferable, as giving in would mean slavery, and thus no one would be saved. At this point Zunesha started talking to Momonosuke, claiming it could hear the \"Drums of Liberation\" which signified the awakening of Joy Boy.
