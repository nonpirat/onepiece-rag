{"content": "Whisky Peak Arc(Chapters 106 to 114, Volumes 12 and 13)\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nThe arc begins with the Straw Hat Crew out in the ocean in the starting leg of the Grand Line. They are quickly introduced to the abnormality of the place, as they experience the ever-changing weather and tides, which constantly keep the crew (save for a sleeping Zoro) on their toes. Eventually, the weather stabilizes and the crew spots an island on the horizon, and on it, the town Whisky Peak. Upon reaching the town, Mr. 9 and Miss Wednesday thank the crew and jump ship, much to the crew's confusion. Since the Log Pose needs time to reset, the crew have no choice but to dock at the mysterious island. Much to their surprise, the residents welcome them as if they are heroes. Soon they meet the town's leader, Igarappoi,\u00a0who treats them to a party.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Whisky Peak Arc.txt", "title": "Whisky Peak Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 106 to 114"}}
