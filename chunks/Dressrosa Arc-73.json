{"content": "Gladius, Dellinger, Machvise, Lao G, and Baby 5 went up to the New King's Plateau, where they watched in shock as Luffy, Law, and the gladiators beat back the Donquixote soldiers and reached the first level of the Plateau. Down below, Fujitora and his troops were stopped from pursuing the gladiators by Sabo, who confronted them to protect Luffy. Sabo overwhelmed the Marines as he destroyed their weapons by flexing his fingers, and he did the same to Bastille's sword and mask, defeating the Vice Admiral. Fujitora brought down a meteor, but it was sliced and scattered by the Birdcage. Sabo revealed his relationship to Luffy, and he and Fujitora clashed. The two fought ferociously, and Sabo asked how long Fujitora would waste time fighting him; the Admiral replied that he had decided to bet his life on this course of action.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
