{"content": "They report this to Grove 66, another Marine base, which causes the Marines to mobilize. They are ordered to direct the civilians away from the Grove which will soon become a battlefield as reinforcements from G-1 would later arrive. Among them is Sentomaru, who decides to bring along two Pacifistas. He warns his troops not to underestimate the crew as they may have gotten stronger in the last two years, especially their captain, Luffy, whom he declares to be an entirely different caliber than the usual over 100,000,000 bounty rookies that gather at the Archipelago.\n\nMeanwhile, in Grove 42, Sanji comes across a fisherman and tries to buy some fish, but the man is panicking because he had a client who wanted to go fishing. The fisherman told him to get on the boat, but instead the man got on a pirate ship by mistake, which took off underwater. When Sanji hears the description of the man, he realizes who it is and tells the fisherman not to panic as the man can take care of himself.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Return to Sabaody Arc.txt", "title": "Return to Sabaody Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 598 to 602"}}
