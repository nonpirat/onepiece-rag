{"content": "Three days later, the citizens approached the execution site and saw a large pot of boiling oil, and Oden and his Scabbards were being ushered towards it. Oden stopped and turned to face Orochi and Kaidou who were watching the event from a stage, and asked for a chance for him and his men to live. Kaidou agreed and said that if they survived an hour inside the pot, they were free to go. Oden then entered the pot and held his retainers above his head on a platform, saving them from the torture. The watchers then ridiculed Oden for his actions five years too late, and about how long it was taking him to die. Angered, Shinobu revealed the truth behind the deal Oden made with Orochi five years ago, that involved Oden dancing naked in order to stop Orochi from kidnapping and selling the citizens, and for him and Kaidou to leave Wano in five years.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
