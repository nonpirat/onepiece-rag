{"content": "Nami realized that Lola was Big Mom's daughter and the sister that Pudding mentioned, and when Randolph attempted to attack her and Luffy, Cracker blew him and the other homies away with just his voice. Cracker stated he had come to deal with Luffy's group to eliminate them before the Vinsmokes all arrived, much to the chagrin of Br\u00fbl\u00e9e and the homie Kingbaum. Cracker prepared to kill Pound first, but Luffy blocked his sword strike, and the homies ran in fear from the powerful clash. Nami and Pound ran away and were chased by Br\u00fbl\u00e9e and the homies, but Nami pulled out the Vivre Card Lola gave her, and her suspicions were confirmed as the homies were repelled by the soul of Big Mom in the card. However, Cracker quickly overpowered Luffy, and Br\u00fbl\u00e9e confronted Nami, saying they would have no chance of getting anywhere close to Sanji or Big Mom. Br\u00fbl\u00e9e then attempted to grab Nami and pull her into the Mirro-World, but Pound attacked his ex-stepdaughter, allowing Nami to strike Br\u00fbl\u00e9e with Thunderbolt Tempo.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Whole Cake Island Arc.txt", "title": "Whole Cake Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 825 to 902"}}
