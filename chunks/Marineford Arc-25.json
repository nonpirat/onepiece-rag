{"content": "He reports over the Den Den Mushi that they are putting the plan into motion. Other Marine officials get the order too, which Whitebeard notices, making him wonder what Sengoku is up to. Garp suddenly climbs up to the execution stand, which prompts Sengoku to ask if he has a problem with the plan. Garp says that he does not, claiming that Ace is a pirate and that he feels no pity for him. However, he then states that Ace is also family, which puts Garp in conflict with what he is supposed to do. He scolds Ace, asking him why he did not just live as he had told him to. Sengoku warns Garp that if he tries anything, he will not hold back, but Garp just brushes him off, saying that if he could've done anything, he would've already done it.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
