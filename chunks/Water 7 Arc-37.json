{"content": "Though Franky decides to help rescue Robin, Usopp refuses to, citing that he is no longer a member of the crew, and walks away. Minutes later, however, a masked man in a cape who looks exactly like Usopp, calling himself \"Sogeking\", appears before them and says that Usopp told him about the entire situation and that he is willing to help. Sanji and Franky see right through his disguise, but decide not to say anything.\n\nAs Captain T Bone, a zombie-like but honorable knight swordsman, and his soldiers look through the last two cars, the three intruders detach them from the rest of the train, leaving very few people left. They enter the next car, which holds the kitchen, and encounter the CP7 chef Wanze, a very odd-looking and energetic man that makes ramen with his nose hairs and fights using Ramen Kenpo. Sanji holds him off as Franky and Sogeking continue to the next car.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Water 7 Arc.txt", "title": "Water 7 Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 322 to 374"}}
