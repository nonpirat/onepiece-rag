{"content": "- Two important decisions are made for the Straw Hat Pirates on their next objectives which would foreshadow the events for the Water 7 Arc: Nami suggesting to use the money they earned from the treasures found in Skypiea to repair the Going Merry, along with Luffy making an intelligent choice to find and recruit a shipwright for the crew (in the anime this takes place during the G-8 filler arc).\n- The defeat dealt by Aokiji prompts Luffy to create new fighting techniques, that will be Gear 2 and Gear 3 used for the first time during the Enies Lobby Arc. However, the defeat also had a negative impact on Usopp who begins to question his strength in the crew. It later came to a boiling point in the Water 7 Arc following the beating he received from the Franky Family, his inability to protect the money to fix the ship, and the conflict with the Going Merry prompted him to leave the crew over his feelings of inadequacy as a Straw Hat.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Long Ring Long Land Arc.txt", "title": "Long Ring Long Land Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 303 to 321"}}
