{"content": "Whitebeard then attempts to contact Squard, but he is nowhere to be found, having been seen only minutes ago. Brushing this off, Whitebeard instead cuts through to the Decalvan Brothers, whom he commands to take command of all the pirates. All of Whitebeard's subordinate crews then begin to split up, attacking Marineford from the left and right sides. Seeing the battleships being attacked, Garp and Sengoku realize that Whitebeard saw through their plan.\n\nMeanwhile, Moria, unable to form zombies in the presence of Jinbe, steals the shadows of Marine soldiers and inserts them into his body, increasing his size and strength. He then lunges towards Jinbe, hoping to steal his shadow, but the fish-man retaliates with Samegawara Seiken, slamming his fist into Moria and critically wounding him.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
