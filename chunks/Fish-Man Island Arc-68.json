{"content": "Meanwhile, at Coral Hill, the citizens of Fish-Man Island throw accusations at Sanji and Chopper thinking them to be responsible for the mermaid kidnappings. Sanji claims otherwise while Chopper treats Hatchan. Megalo soon floats above the area and Luffy spots Sanji and Chopper. He jumps down to meet them and is surprised at Hatchan's wounded form. One of the Fish-Man Island citizens wonders what Luffy is doing at Coral Hill when he was supposed to be taking over Ryugu Palace. Another citizen thinks that the Straw Hats plan to kidnap the Mermaid Princess, but the others doubt it since Shirahoshi is big and she is under the protection of Neptune. However, Megalo reaches his limit and spits out Shirahoshi right in front of the crowd. The residents instantly interpret this as a Mermaid Princess kidnapping while Chopper warns Sanji not to relapse as he may lose his life this time.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
