{"content": "At Mary Geoise, a meeting of the Marines and the Seven Warlords of the Sea was being held to discuss what should be done about replacing the Warlord Crocodile. Much to then-Fleet Admiral Sengoku's surprise, two of the Seven Warlords (Bartholomew Kuma and Donquixote Doflamingo) were in attendance when Hawkeye Mihawk arrived.
