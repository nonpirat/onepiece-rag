{"content": "- Franky is revealed to have spent the Straw Hats' money on the exceptionally rare and durable Adam Wood, which his mentor Tom used to build the Oro Jackson, the only ship durable enough to reach Laugh Tale. Franky was working to further his own dream of building a ship that will sail through the entire Grand Line and didn't actually waste the stolen funds. As a means of making amends for his thievery, he uses the wood to construct the Thousand Sunny.\n- Garp's surname and true identity are revealed, as well as the progress of Koby and Helmeppo.\n- Back in Loguetown, Luffy was saved from Smoker by a mysterious man named Dragon. Ever since, Dragon has almost never been mentioned up until this point (it's mentioned at the Levely where they discussed about the danger of Dragon), when Garp reveals to Luffy that Dragon is his father, the leader of the Revolutionaries. The Revolutionary Army's main base is revealed as well, to be Baltigo.\n- Curly Dadan is first mentioned.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-Enies Lobby Arc.txt", "title": "Post-Enies Lobby Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 431 to 441"}}
