{"content": "Voices roar as Fake Luffy boosts the spirits of his followers, who all believe that following him will lead their pirating careers to greater heights, having achieved such notoriety in the past for inflicting massive damage on the World Government's three prominent facilities (Enies Lobby, Impel Down, and Marineford). Some of them even root for him as a worthy candidate for the next Pirate King, and being part of his crew meant some shared glory in the future. He appropriates them as extensions of himself, his \"hands\" and \"legs.\" His orders are to find and crush the real Straw Hats that humiliated him. During his rant, Fake Zoro and Fake Sanji return with the real Luffy. Luffy speaks to the fakes, assuming them to be the real ones, yet noticing that they are more friendly than he remembers. The fakes call for their captain's attention, and the target, Luffy, stands before his eyes.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Return to Sabaody Arc.txt", "title": "Return to Sabaody Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 598 to 602"}}
