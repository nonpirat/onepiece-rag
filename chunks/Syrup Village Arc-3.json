{"content": "Kuro allows Usopp to flee because no one would believe him, which proves to be true as the villagers choose not to believe his warnings. When Usopp tries to warn Kaya, she thinks that he is trying to kidnap her. Merry, armed with a gun, chases him off. Usopp then lies to his crew in order to protect them from harm. However, the Straw Hats are aware of the situation, and decide to lend aid to Usopp and Kaya and prepare by setting up traps. That night, Merry gives Klahadore a pair of glasses that Kaya bought for his three years of service, only for Klahadore to destroy them and reveal his true intentions of taking Kaya's estate, before attacking Merry to prevent him from warning her. Kuro's ship and crew will arrive at Syrup Village the next day, where they believe they will find no resistance.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Syrup Village Arc.txt", "title": "Syrup Village Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 22 to 41"}}
