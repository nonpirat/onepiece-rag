{"content": "Unfortunately, he gets hit hard by cannon fire and begins to double over. As he does, Little Oars Jr. notices Doflamingo and tries to take him out, slamming at him with his fist. Doflamingo manages to avoid the attack, flips over Oars, and uses his ability to cut off his right leg in the process, laughing all the while. Despite this, Little Oars Jr. desperately continues to advance towards Ace. Just as he is within inches of grabbing Ace, Moria sends his shadows at the giant, forming them into a spear and skewering him through the midsection. The Whitebeard Pirates look on in horror as Little Oars Jr. falls, while the Warlords of the Sea give off different reactions, with Moria happy with his victory.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
