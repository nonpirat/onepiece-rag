Meanwhile, only four hours remain until Ace's execution.\n\nBack in Impel Down, the Blackbeard Pirates are seen alive and well again, making their way through Level 4, having been saved by Shiryu, who\u00a0comments on their fight with Magellan. The Blackbeard\u00a0Pirates, however, praise their\u00a0luck\u00a0for getting the antidote to cure themselves from the poison and managing to survive another day. Blackbeard thanks Shiryu for saving them and invites the former\u00a0Head Jailer of Impel Down to join them, which he accepts knowing what will happen if he stays in the prison. He also comments that he was waiting for a man like Blackbeard.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
