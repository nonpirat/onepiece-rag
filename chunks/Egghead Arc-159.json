{"content": "The citizens then wanted Kuma to succeed Bekori as king of Sorbet. But as he was hailed as the king, he posed as a figurehead to the real king Bulldog, who ruled Sorbet before Bekori and was well respected by the citizens. Suddenly, a girl ran around the church, and everyone was shocked that it was Bonney, having eaten a Devil Fruit at one point that changes her appearance by age. Shortly after, Bulldog and the queen dowager Conney visited the church to tell Kuma that the World Government has framed him as a dictator that seized the throne with violence, presumably as part of Bekori's attempt to take back his status as king. Kuma then decided to entrust Bonney and the throne to Bulldog before he left to drive Bekori's threat away from Sorbet.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
