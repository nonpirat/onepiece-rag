{"content": "Luffy began fighting Doflamingo again, and as they clashed, their Haoshoku Haki created a black lightning-like effect. Trebol remembered when he, Vergo, Diamante, and Pica swore their allegiance to Doflamingo as children after discovering that he had Haoshoku Haki, and they treated him like the king that they believed those with the ability were, with Trebol giving Doflamingo his Devil Fruit and gun. After a ferocious fight, Trebol managed to catch Luffy in his mucus, and Luffy could not escape. Trebol then trapped Law and left him for Doflamingo to finish off, telling Law that the executives and Doflamingo had created a strong family. Law retorted that this was a lie, and Trebol attacked him in a fit of rage, allowing Law to use his Devil Fruit powers to spin his sword and vertically cut Trebol. The attack caused all the mucus to fall off Trebol's body, and in a desperate fit he lit up the mucus to create a massive explosion.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
