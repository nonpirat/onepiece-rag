{"content": "However, Luffy was approached by Gatz, the announcer of the Corrida Colosseum. He revealed to Gatz that he needed ten minutes to regain his Haki, and he could finish off Doflamingo in one blow after that. Gatz then called in the Colosseum gladiators who had initially gone after Luffy and his comrades for Doflamingo's bounties, and they went to confront Doflamingo while Gatz carried Luffy away. They were attacked by Burgess, but the Blackbeard Pirate was intercepted by Sabo. Sabo revealed his new Devil Fruit powers to Burgess and Luffy, and Burgess attacked, but Sabo sent him flying. However, Gatz saw Doflamingo easily take down the gladiators, and the Warlord sped up the Birdcage so it would kill everyone before Luffy recovered. Law then went into the streets, and told Gatz to leave Luffy with him for the rest of his recovery period.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
