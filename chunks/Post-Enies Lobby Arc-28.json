This foreshadows his impact through his inventions and discoveries in the Thriller Bark, Sabaody Archipelago, Marineford, Punk Hazard, Whole Cake Island, Wano Country and Egghead Arcs.\n- After having spent a significant time hunting him down for the murder of Thatch, Ace finally catches up with the Blackbeard Pirates on Banaro Island and challenges the treacherous Blackbeard to a duel. The unique qualities of Blackbeard's Devil Fruit (namely his ability to disable others' Devil Fruit powers) enables him to defeat Ace, and he hands him over to the Marines in exchange for a spot in the Seven Warlords of the Sea. This would act as a trigger towards the Impel Down and Marineford Arcs.\n- This arc also mentions the New World and the Four Emperors who will play major roles in the Marineford, Whole Cake Island and Wano Country Arcs.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-Enies Lobby Arc.txt", "title": "Post-Enies Lobby Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 431 to 441"}}
