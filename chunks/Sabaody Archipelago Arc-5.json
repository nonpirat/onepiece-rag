As the Sunny nears the base, Camie is worried that her friend is in danger.\n\nThe Straw Hats enter the base, and they notice it is too quiet. They find out that the base is not an island, but a small village built in the middle of the sea. Camie and Pappag call out to Hatchan, who after seeing the Jolly Roger of the Straw Hats, covers himself in his own ink to disguise himself in order to protect his friends. The Straw Hats know that they are walking into a trap, but Camie and Pappag freak out when Franky yells at them of how blind they are to the obvious. They find Hatchan in a cage in front them warning them about the trap.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
