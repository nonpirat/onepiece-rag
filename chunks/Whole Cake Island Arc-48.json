{"content": "Bege pretended to go after Luffy, and Brook went to them to tell them to show Big Mom the pieces of the Carmel portrait. Katakuri then confronted them, and Bege shot the Sweet Commander to give Luffy time. Katakuri avoided various attacks from the enemy alliance as he pursued Luffy, but subdued Luffy too late as Luffy stretched his arms in front of Big Mom's face, showing her the portrait pieces. Big Mom then entered a crisis, unleashing Haoshoku Haki that knocked out several guests and a scream that immobilized everyone else. The Straw Hat-Fire Tank Alliance members put on earplugs, and with the assassins incapacitated, Sanji freed his family from their bindings as they were given earplugs as well. As she screamed, Big Mom despaired over Mother Carmel, wanting to know where she had gone.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Whole Cake Island Arc.txt", "title": "Whole Cake Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 825 to 902"}}
