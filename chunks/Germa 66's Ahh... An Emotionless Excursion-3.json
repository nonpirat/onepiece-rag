{"content": "As she continues to walk with her brothers, Reiju suspects someone else is around the corridor, who is in fact Caesar Clown, who failed to escape Whole Cake Island. Suddenly, both Oven and Katakuri appear and attack the Vinsmokes, but Caesar moves in and shrouds everyone with a hallucinatory gas. He then begs for the Vinsmokes to take him with them while the Charlotte brothers inadvertently fight each other due to the effect of the gas they were in. The Vinsmokes apparently agree to this and they all fly away from the fallen castle together.\n\nMeanwhile, Chocolat Town and its residents are all completely frozen in ice. As Cracker lays on the ground defeated while also frozen, Br\u00fbl\u00e9e wallows in tears that Pudding had been kidnapped by the invaders, who turn out to be Kuzan and Van Augur of the Blackbeard Pirates.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Germa 66's Ahh...
