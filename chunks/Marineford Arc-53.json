{"content": "Moria, having apparently given up on his battle with Jinbe, confronts Tenth Division Commander Curiel, saying that whether he fights Moria or continues into the bay, he will be destroyed. Moreover, he says that while he does not care who wins, it would be hilarious if Whitebeard died. Curiel responds by firing his guns at Moria, stating that he will not let Whitebeard or Ace die. Mihawk and Vista continue their clash. Mihawk says that their duel must come to an end, to which Vista replies that they each have a point in their favor. Tashigi and Smoker, apparently no longer fighting Hancock, move on, saying that they are done there. Hancock, meanwhile, hopes Luffy can reach his brother on time.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
