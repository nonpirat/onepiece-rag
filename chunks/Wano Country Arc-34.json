{"content": "Meanwhile, X Drake and Page One, two of the strongest six Shinuchi known as the Tobiroppo, went through the Flower Capital to look for Sanji. Law snuck up to Sanji and told him to go hide, and they along with Usopp and Sanji ran off. However, Page One started rampaging in his spinosaurus form and attacked citizens to draw Sanji out. This worked as Sanji attacked Page One, and as Page One called X Drake for backup, Sanji assured his comrades that he would finish this quickly without being spotted as he pulled out his Raid Suit. Sanji donned the Raid Suit, and Law recognized him as the character Stealth Black from Sora, Warrior of the Sea. Sanji became invisible and attacked Page One by surprise, sending him crashing into a building. Page One transformed into his hybrid form and hit Sanji through multiple buildings with his immense strength. However, Sanji was barely hurt and attacked Page One from above, and Law, Usopp, and Franky fled the Flower Capital and headed toward Ebisu Town.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
