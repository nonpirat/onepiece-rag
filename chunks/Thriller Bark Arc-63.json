{"content": "In the West Blue, more than fifty years ago, the Rumbar Pirates encountered a baby whale who had strayed from his pod and decided to sing a song to cheer him up. Not long after, all the Rumbar Pirates grew fond of him and named him Laboon. When they were approaching the Grand Line, they knew that it was too dangerous for Laboon to come, so they ignored him, hoping he would leave and try to find his pod. After coming down from Reverse Mountain, they discovered that Laboon had followed them. Three months later, they leave Laboon at Twin Capes and promise to return. Three years have passed now and the Captain of the Rumbar Pirates, \"Calico\" Yorki, and some of the crew have fallen ill with a virus their doctor cannot cure. Filled with regret, he asks Brook to keep their promise to Laboon for them as he and the other infected members meet their deaths trying to escape through the Calm Belt.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Thriller Bark Arc.txt", "title": "Thriller Bark Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 442 to 489"}}
