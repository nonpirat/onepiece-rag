{"content": "Back in the present, Brook takes a Tone Dial out of his skull that contains the final song the Rumbar Pirates performed before they died. As the song plays, the Straw Hats and Rolling Pirates join in, and Brook remembers how the rest of the Rumbar Pirates fought against enemy pirates that use poisoned weapons. He also remembers how they went from a band, to a quartet, a trio, a duet, and finally a solo as Brook finally died remembering Laboon.\n\nIn the present, Brook still has the pride of a pirate and resolves to meet Laboon from the \"front\" as promised. Brook decides to seal the Tone Dial away inside his skull and joins Luffy's crew. At Reverse Mountain, Laboon is shown in good spirits as he lets out a terrific roar. Brook shows the others his wanted poster as he is known as \"Humming Brook\" with a bounty of 33,000,000 and pledges his life to Luffy.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Thriller Bark Arc.txt", "title": "Thriller Bark Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 442 to 489"}}
