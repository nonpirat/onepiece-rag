{"content": "Meanwhile, Gyro and his crew continue with their escape. Before they can get very far, Hody appears in front of them, handcuffed, and drills inside the ship. He emerges under the deck while chomping down on a pirate. Despite all the efforts of the crew, Hody continues to destroy the ship and crew with his jaws alone. As Hody continues with his rampage, the New Fish-Man Pirates remark about the pills called Energy Steroids, which double the user's strength for each dose. However, in exchange for the boost in strength, the drug shaves away the user's lifespan. Because they do not fear death, the fish-men disregard the negative side effect. The pirates on the ship realize that Hody has handcuffed himself to show that he does not need his hands to destroy them.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
