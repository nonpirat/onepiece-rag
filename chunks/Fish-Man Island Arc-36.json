{"content": "Back in Coral Hill, Shyarly is suddenly causing a commotion and screaming in the street after seeing a prediction on her crystal ball. She warns of a person wearing a straw hat and yells that they must get him to leave. She assumes this person to be Luffy and cries out that he will destroy Fish-Man Island.\n\nBack in the Noah District, a group of pirates are fleeing back to their ship. Their captain, \"Crab Hand\" Gyro, comments how they were strong-armed into serving the New Fish-Man Pirates. We then go to the leader and officers of the said pirates: Officers Dosun (a hammerhead shark), Zeo (a Japanese wobbegong), Daruma (a cookiecutter shark), Ikaros Much (a giant squid), and their captain, Hody Jones (a great white shark). A member of the New Fish-Man Pirates informs Hody and the officers about Gyro's escape. Hody tells his crew that he will take care of it, taking a batch of pills that suddenly increase his strength.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
