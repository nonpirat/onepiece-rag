{"content": "Back at the execution stand, Sengoku tells Garp that he is going to tell the audience \"everything\", to which Garp replies that he can do as he wishes. Sengoku then takes the stage and orders the executioners to step back a moment before addressing the audience through a Den Den Mushi. He begins by stating there was something critical he needed to share about Ace before asking the Second Division Commander who his father was. Ace replies that Whitebeard is his father, but Sengoku claims he is not. Sengoku then goes on to say that the Marines searched an island for the possibility that a certain man had born a child. Newborns, children yet to be born, and even the mothers, but they did not find anything. However, there was a reason for it, and that was Ace's mother.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
