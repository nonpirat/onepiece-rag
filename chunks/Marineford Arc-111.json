{"content": "Buggy yells at Shanks for lying about the treasure map, with Shanks justifying his lie by saying it was a spur of the moment decision, while Buggy continues to yell at Shanks, clearly holding his grudge. Buggy's followers comically admire Buggy's attitude towards Shanks, continuing to swear loyalty to him. Buggy then thinks that if he stays with the Red Hair Pirates, he will be able to get off the island safely. Shanks then orders Marco to withdraw in order to stop encouraging the battle. While this happens, Mihawk walks away, telling the Marines that he was only told to participate in the war against Whitebeard and that fighting Shanks is not part of the agreement. Shanks threatens the Marines, saying that if there are any others who wish to fight, then he and his crew will fight them. Upon asking Blackbeard, Teach quickly decides to postpone their battle, satisfied with getting what he came for, and leaves shortly thereafter.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
