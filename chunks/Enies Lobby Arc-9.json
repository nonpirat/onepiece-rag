{"content": "Luffy attempted to get it back, but Fukurou evaded with Soru. When he reappeared, he tells the crew that the key he has may or may not be the one to Robin's cuffs. He goes on to say that, including him, there are five CP9 members in the building, each with a key, and only one would release Robin's handcuffs. The Straw Hats would need to defeat all of CP9 to be sure that they had the right key. Nami suggested that they retrieve Robin first, but Fukurou threatened to throw the key into the ocean if she does. Fukurou tells them that CP9 is giving them a chance, then fled into the building.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Enies Lobby Arc.txt", "title": "Enies Lobby Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 375 to 430"}}
