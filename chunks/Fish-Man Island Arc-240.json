{"content": "As that goes on, on the surface near the Red Line, the pirates that were leaving Fish-Man Island come across a Marine blockade. One of the pirate ships fires on a certain Marine ship which the crew call for Tashigi, now a Captain to the G-5 base, to help them. Indeed, she does, deflecting a cannonball away from the ship with her sword then scolds her subordinates for their goofiness. Meanwhile, Smoker, now a Vice Admiral, interrogates some captured pirates who explain they were held captive by Hody Jones in Fish-Man Island. They try to keep it secret that it was Luffy who defeated him out of debt for saving them, but one of the pirates lets this slip. However, Smoker could already tell who it was just based on their story alone.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
