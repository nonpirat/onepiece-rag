{"content": "In the Performance Floor, Zoro managed to cut a portion of King's mask, which enraged the Calamity, who entered his hybrid form and started to fire off indiscriminate cutting attacks, which hurt friend and foe alike to get at Zoro. His attacks were powerful enough to send Zoro flying into the Right Brain Tower, where Franky was, who managed to catch the swordsman. Franky offered to help, but the swordsman instead requested he stay away, which the cyborg easily agreed to. King then flew at Zoro at high-speed attacking with Tankyudon, which the Pirate Hunter attempted to counter with Ul-Tora Gari, and though the Wildfire pushed back Zoro in this clash, his mask was further damaged by the swordsman. Zoro then realized that he was being pushed of the island, so he used the recoil from Two Sword Style: Clear Lance to push himself back on the island. As the battle continued outside the Skull Dome, Zoro received the call from Sanji, and though he accepted the request, he told the cook to come back alive.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
