On the base of the belfry is a Poneglyph, which Robin deciphers to be information on the location of the ancient weapon Poseidon. With this, the Shandia find out that they have no need to protect it anymore, so they no longer have to fight. To Robin's surprise, however, there is another message on the gold itself, from Gol D.

In order to thank the Straw Hats, they offer one of the belfry's pillars, which Robin accepts.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Skypiea Arc.txt", "title": "Skypiea Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 237 to 302"}}
