{"content": "On a nearby station, they met with the stationmaster named Kokoro and her granddaughter Chimney, along with her pet rabbit (who acts like a cat) Gonbe. After revealing that the frog, Yokozuna, was perfectly fine and that it was always testing its strength against the train, Kokoro explained that the train was a Sea Train that connects several of the nearby islands and is called the Puffing Tom. She then told them that the Log Pose would lead them to Water 7, a city of shipwrights where they could fix their ship, and told them to get help from a man named Iceburg.\n\nThe crew arrived at the city, which resembled a fountain, and sailed through the canals in the city looking for a place to dock, but the people were kind enough to tell them where to hide their boat. After stopping, a group of Luffy, Nami, and Usopp headed out to exchange their gold from Skypiea and find a shipwright, using creatures called yagaras to navigate the canals.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Water 7 Arc.txt", "title": "Water 7 Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 322 to 374"}}
