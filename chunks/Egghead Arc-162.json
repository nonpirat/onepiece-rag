{"content": "At Mary Geoise, Saturn voiced his disappointment with Vegapunk for not taking full advantage of the project. After saying soldiers are valuable by how many people that are capable of killing, he revealed he would put his own agenda in effect. Just then, a group of Marines led by Kizaru had arrived at the lab as the Admiral revealed to Vegapunk that there was a Surveillance Den Den Mushi watching him and that there could not be any deals made with pirates in secret.
