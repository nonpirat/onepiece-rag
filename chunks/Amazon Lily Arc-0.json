In Grove 1, at the auction house, Saint Shalria is complaining to the Marines about their lack of seriousness towards the Straw Hat Pirates and also why they haven't been captured yet. It is also seen that she vows to show them hell on Earth. At Shakky's Rip-off Bar, Camie is also worried about the Straw Hats, though Pappag and Hatchan think otherwise. Shakky remains neutral about commenting on them facing an Admiral, before remarking that this pirate age is slowly beginning to move.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Amazon Lily Arc.txt", "title": "Amazon Lily Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 514 to 524"}}
