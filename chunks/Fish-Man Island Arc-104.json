He knew that there are kind-hearted humans out there but if things keep going as they are, all there will be left is hatred. It was this reasoning that he felt that his body will reject the human blood if given to him and that no matter how hard he tried, he could never love a human.

Happy to hear this, Tiger died from his wounds and his crew grieved his passing.\n\nSometime later, Arlong returned to Foolshout Island with the intent to take revenge on the villagers for their part in Fisher Tiger's death.
