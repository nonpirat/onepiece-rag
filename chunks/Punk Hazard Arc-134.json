{"content": "As everyone enjoys themselves, a few of Smoker's men tell him that they got the \"killer\" gases weakness out of Caesar and are going back into the island to rescue their comrades. Law comes over to which Smoker comments he is amazed Law kept his word, though wonders what he is using the Straw Hats for. Law queries he wonders who's using who, as he thinks back to when he made the alliance with Luffy in order to defeat Kaidou. A flashback then occurs to the event. When Law reveals he is after Kaidou, Luffy accepts, saying his goal is to defeat all the Emperors (as long as the one is someone other than Shanks). Law claims that their goals coincide, but Luffy shouldn't underestimate them, for even with his plan and their alliance, their chances in defeating Kaidou are only about 30%. However, Luffy accepts his offer regardless of the disadvantage.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
