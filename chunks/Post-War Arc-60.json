{"content": "In East Blue, we find Robin making her way across the huge bridge via carriage thanks to the Revolutionaries who freed her from slavery. They explain that they have been searching for her for ten years since the destruction of Ohara and are under orders from Dragon to protect her. While appreciative of the offer, Robin declines, mentioning she has her own crew and wishes to get back to them. Not long after she leaves, the Revolutionaries who stayed behind get the newspaper and find out what went on with Luffy. They send one of the carrier crows to deliver it to Robin. The lead revolutionary explains about the bridge and how it was ordered by the Celestial Dragons to be made, and that it has cost many slaves their lives during construction. The paper soon reaches the carriage and is handed off to Robin, who learns of Luffy's current status as well as something else about him.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
