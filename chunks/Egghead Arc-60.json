{"content": "Back on Egghead, Sentomaru had awakened and ordered a Pacifista Mark III to detain the other Cipher Pol agents in the Fabiriophase. Still unable to contact Vegapunk or receive reports from the outside world, Sentomaru deployed all fifty Pacifistas Mark III and ordered them to aid in the Straw Hats' escape with Vegapunk.\n\nIn the Labophase, Luffy, Zoro, Brook, and Stussy regrouped with the others after Luffy was unable to find Vegapunk or Bonney. Checking the monitors, Shaka noted that Bonney was in Room Nikyu but could not see Vegapunk anywhere. Pythagoras was already on the lookout for main body, and seeing as they could not leave without Vegapunk, Nami suggested the crew go look as well. Luffy and Zoro stayed behind to look after the unconscious Lucci and Kaki. As Pythagoras was searching, someone approached him from behind, and an explosion went off in part of the lab.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
