{"content": "On the Plateau, Cavendish approached Luffy and Law, saying that he had a plan. Luffy and Law rode with Cavendish on his horse Farul to reach the third level, and Kyros rode with them. Luffy revealed that they were going to meet Rebecca, and Kyros stated that he wanted to kill Diamante to avenge his wife. Meanwhile, the Donquixote Pirate officers confronted and overpowered the other gladiators, but as Farul rode into the battleground, the gladiators cleared a path for Luffy and his entourage to get to the next level, promising to keep the Donquixote officers at bay. Although Dellinger took out Suleiman, Dagama, and Blue Gilly, the gladiators continued the fight, and Cavendish stated that there would be no way to get off the island except by beating Doflamingo. As they reached Level 3, however, they were confronted by giant nutcrackers.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
