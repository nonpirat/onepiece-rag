While Chopper was in a bookstore, a masked man walked past Robin and simply said, \"CP9,\" which left her in shock. When Chopper came out, Robin was gone.\n\nMeanwhile, several bounty hunters came onto the Going Merry to claim the bounty on the crew, but they underestimated Zoro's power and were quickly defeated.\n\nLuffy's group managed to exchange the gold for 300,000,000 and they went to Dock One of the Galley-La Company. There, they met Kaku, one of the foremen, who revealed that Iceburg was the mayor of Water 7, and the president of Galley-La.
