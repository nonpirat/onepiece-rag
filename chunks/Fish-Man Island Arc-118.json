{"content": "Otohime then speaks with her sons in private, telling them of the feat Shirahoshi managed with the Sea Kings. She further explains to them that mermaids have the ability to speak to fish but could never do so with Sea Kings. However, every few centuries a mermaid is born with such an ability. There is also a legend that someone will appear to guide the mermaid and that the world will soon change. The princes are astonished at such a story, but their mother warns them that such a power in the wrong hands can sink the world. As Shirahoshi is still quite young, she is not aware of this power nor can control it and another outburst could destroy the whole island. Otohime then tells the princes to become strong warriors so they can look after their sister which the three wholeheartedly agree without hesitation, ready to lay down their lives to save her and help contain her outbursts.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
