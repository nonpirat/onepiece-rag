Zoro comments on Chopper's new Heavy Point stating it looks more like a monster than human. Chopper states that before he wanted to be human to have friends. Now he wishes to be a monster to help Luffy. Hyouzou suddenly rushes to attack Zoro, but Zoro easily counters him stating he gave him a chance to escape his reach. Zoro then cuts two of the blades Hyouzou is holding, telling him to bring the best swordsman in Fish-Man Island as Hyouzou is not even worth killing time with.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
