{"content": "On Weatheria, Nami has been thrown into a small prison for trying to steal a weather ball and some weather knots the people were using for research. Haredas comes by to help her and asks why her mood suddenly changed, showing that, like the other members, she too found out about what happened to Luffy and Ace. She begins to cry and break down, earning the resident's pity. As soon as they release her, Nami, in the blink of an eye, grabs Haredas and the objects that were confiscated from her and is already a good distance away from her captors. Realizing they've been tricked, they set after her while Nami runs and tells Haredas to just drop her anywhere. All the while, she is thinking of Luffy and hoping he will be alright. Haredas points out to Nami that her crocodile tears have not stopped running, but Nami just tells him to shut up.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
