{"content": "Big Mom, however, refuses such an offer but decides to spare Fish-Man Island to instead go after Luffy. She challenges Luffy to come to the New World. Luffy instantly accepts adding that it's too dangerous to leave her in charge of Fish-Man Island. He declares he will defeat her and take Fish-Man Island as his own territory.\n\nMeanwhile, Jinbe speaks with Neptune, explaining that the Sun Pirates were doing fine under Big Mom though his crew was only doing so out of concern for Fish-Man Island after Whitebeard's death. However, Jinbe mentions that he is thinking of cutting ties with Big Mom and joining up with Luffy though worries how Big Mom will react. Neptune understands even mentioning that if they lost Big Mom's flag they can always use \"the Skull and Crossbones wearing a Straw Hat\" much to Jinbe's amusement and agreement.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
