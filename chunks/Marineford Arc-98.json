{"content": "As he was being choked, Blackbeard asks Whitebeard if he would kill his own son. Whitebeard seriously damages Blackbeard's skull, and Blackbeard calls him a monster, cursing him and saying that he should have been dead. He then commands his crew to kill Whitebeard. Whitebeard's sons and subordinates cry and watch in tears as their father is being killed before their eyes. While he is being attacked, Whitebeard suddenly starts remembering when Roger told him about his own death and the true meaning of \"D.\" After the Blackbeard Pirates run out of bullets, Whitebeard tells Blackbeard that he is not the one Roger is waiting for.\n\nWhitebeard tells Sengoku that the bloodline of those who carry the Will of Roger still burns, and that one day, a grand battle that will engulf the whole world will begin. He goes on to say that when someone finds \"that\" treasure, the world will be turned upside-down. He finishes his speech by shouting to the world that the \"One Piece\" exists, much to Sengoku's fury.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
