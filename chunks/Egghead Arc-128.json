{"content": "Meanwhile, in Mary Geoise, Bartholomew Kuma unleashed a rampage, as the soldiers were unable to contain him, and he caused severe damage to the environment with his Ursus Shock. This led to Sakazuki to step in and confront him, all while some World Nobles were complaining about the lack of food, demanding Sakazuki to execute Kuma for injuring them during his rampage. Sakazuki told Kuma he would have to kill him if he did not let the World Government control him anymore, attacking him with Meigo, destroying a portion of Kuma's face. Kuma then started running, but Sakazuki managed to blast off parts of Kuma's legs with his magma shots but was yet unable to prevent Kuma from escaping Mary Geoise. Sakazuki then remembered the time he captured Jewelry Bonney two years ago, telling her father willingly offered to become a weapon, but Bonney refused to believe it at that time. He continued to wonder where Kuma was headed, even when the World Nobles were yelling at him in the background, but he ignored it.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
