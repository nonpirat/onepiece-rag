{"content": "- Zoro's victory over the one hundred bounty hunters in this arc would later contribute to the World Government issuing his first bounty after the events of the Arabasta Arc.\n- Baroque Works is introduced, as well as Nico Robin as Miss All Sunday, who would later join the Straw Hat Pirates.\n- Vivi begins traveling with the Straw Hat Pirates, as she, along with Luffy, Zoro, and Nami, are now on Baroque Works' hit list.\n- Crocodile is the third Warlord of the Sea to be named. Crocodile is also the leader of Baroque Works, code named Mr. 0, who is the main antagonist of the Arabasta Arc.\n- Vivi is the first noble introduced into the series, though she does not show the selfish nature associated with most other nobles in the series.\n- Since they are asleep during the battle at Whisky Peak, Usopp and Sanji are not put on Baroque Works' hit list. This would give them an advantage in their later encounters with Baroque Works, especially Sanji, who unlike Usopp, is not added to the hit list later on.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Whisky Peak Arc.txt", "title": "Whisky Peak Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 106 to 114"}}
