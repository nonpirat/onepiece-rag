{"content": "Marco tries to face Kizaru, but Onigumo appears from behind, clasping a Seastone handcuff on one of his wrists, negating his Phoenix powers. Using this opportunity, Kizaru fills more holes in him with his light spears. Jozu, meanwhile, is left entirely frozen by Aokiji, and his right arm is broken off. The pirates are shocked that the top two Whitebeard commanders were beaten.\n\nSengoku, telling the Marines not to lower their guard yet, orders them to take Whitebeard's head. As the Marines approach Whitebeard, the pirates try to reach him, but he orders them to stay back, saying he does not need their help just yet. He then defeats the oncoming Marines, shouting \"I am Whitebeard,\" sending multiple Marines flying and causing others to call him a monster.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
