{"content": "Back in the Shikkearu Kingdom, Zoro goes back to Mihawk's castle and bows, begging Mihawk to train him. Mihawk dismisses Zoro's plea, thinking he is coming back after being defeated. Zoro reveals he defeated all the humandrills but admits that at his level, he will not be able to surpass Mihawk. Mihawk realizes he is not doing it for himself, and soon agrees to train Zoro once his body is healed. While Perona is fixing up his wounds, Zoro reveals the message Luffy sent to his crew. A tattoo on his arm that said \"3D2Y.\" Zoro explains that the 3D meant they were supposed to meet at Sabaody in 3 days, but since it was crossed out and replaced with 2Y, that means the time to meet again is now two years. Luffy had purposefully drawn attention to himself to get the message out to the crew, knowing that they would need to strengthen themselves if they wished to take on the New World.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
