{"content": "Before charging into the battle, Luffy informs Whitebeard that he heard the Marines' plan to execute Ace ahead of schedule. Whitebeard realizes that while the information is important, Sengoku purposely leaked it so that the pirates panic and fall into his trap. As Marco joins Whitebeard's side, Luffy bolts towards Ace. Kizaru attempts to stop him by launching a kick of light at him. The attack is stopped, however, by Ivankov's Death Wink, causing the two forces to collide in a massive explosion. When Luffy thanks him, Ivankov states that it is his duty to make sure Luffy does not go and kill himself. Buggy and the inmates, meanwhile, watch on in horror, unwilling to join such a terrifying battle yet acting as if Buggy is rallying them on.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
