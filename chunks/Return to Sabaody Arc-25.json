{"content": "Luffy, however, dodges the blast and goes into Gear 2, then takes to the air and hits the Pacifista as it tries to fire again, knocking it out in one hit. Everyone is shocked by the feat, especially Sentomaru, as he noticed that Luffy had Haki equipped. As Luffy leaves the area, he sees the real Zoro and Sanji running towards him. However, another Pacifista gets in their way and prepares to fire. But both instantly hit it with their attacks, cutting and breaking Pacifista's neck in the process. The pirates soon realize that these Straw Hats are indeed the real deal.\n\nAs Zoro and Sanji prepare to exit the area, they notice Luffy has not moved yet. Luffy yells out to Rayleigh, who is on a far-off hill observing the area and making sure Luffy is alright. Luffy thanks him for everything over the last two years and yells that he is going to be the Pirate King. The pirates are left speechless while Sanji, Zoro, and Rayleigh just smile, the latter with tears in his eyes.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Return to Sabaody Arc.txt", "title": "Return to Sabaody Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 598 to 602"}}
