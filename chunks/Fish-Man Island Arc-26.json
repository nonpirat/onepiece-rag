{"content": "Luffy's group gets acquainted with the mermaids. Sanji happily swims with them while Luffy, Usopp, Chopper, and Camie relax. Chopper and Usopp comment that Sanji seems to have gotten better, to which the former mentions that he is out of blood packs and that Sanji's blood type is rather rare. Luffy then asks Camie if he could see Jinbe, mentioning that Jinbe saved him after Ace died. However, Camie tells him that Jinbe left the island with the Fish-Man Pirates since he revoked his title as a Warlord of the Sea and that so much on the island has changed since then. Before she can go into detail, the quintuplets come rushing to them, telling them that a royal gondola is headed their way, possibly to arrest the Straw Hats. The mermaids hide Luffy's group as the three princes from the Neptune House of the Ryugu Kingdom arrive. The princes are Fukaboshi, a shark merman; Ryuboshi, an oarfish merman; and Manboshi, a moonfish merman.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
