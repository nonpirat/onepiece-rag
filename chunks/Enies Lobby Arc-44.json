{"content": "Despite being attacked again and again by Lucci, Luffy still fought back. Lucci hit Luffy with another Rokuougan, but this time, Luffy does not fall. Using everything he has left, Luffy bombards Lucci with an all-out Gomu Gomu no Jet Gatling, crushing him through the tower wall and finally defeating him. After the Marines and the crew witness Lucci's defeat, Luffy fell to the floor, exhausted but triumphant. Luffy then calls out to Robin that they are going back together, causing her to tearfully smile.\n\nThe Marines are shocked at the loss of Rob Lucci, whom they considered to be the strongest in all of CP9's history. Usopp, Franky, and the rest of the crew, letting out a sigh of relief, began to congratulate Luffy and his victory.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Enies Lobby Arc.txt", "title": "Enies Lobby Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 375 to 430"}}
