Once they have left, Shirahoshi apologizes to Luffy for her outburst after realizing he was the one to save Megalo. They talk while Luffy eats some of her food. Shirahoshi reveals that Decken has a \"curse\" known as \"Mato-Mato,\" which allows him to target anything from any location. As such, it is unsafe for her to go outside, and she has been locked up in the Hard-Shell Tower for ten years.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
