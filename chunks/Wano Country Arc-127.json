{"content": "Recognizing Luffy as the man they had fought earlier, Page One and Ulti attempted to block his way to Kaidou, but were distracted away by Nami and Usopp. Scratchmen Apoo also showed up and tried another surprise attack through his Devil Fruit ability but was foiled by Luffy's advanced Kenbunshoku Haki. Disappointed about the defeat of three of the Numbers, Apoo ordered Hatcha to fight as well. However, thinking that General Franky looked like a toy, the Number was lured outside the Live Stage by Franky. Meanwhile, Zoro and Drake dueled due to the former's mistrust of the latter, but eventually decided to team up in order to prevent Apoo from summoning more Numbers. The two were then assaulted by Queen, who was targeting them from the castle's balcony.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
