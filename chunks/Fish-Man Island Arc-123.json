{"content": "The flashback ends as Jinbe tells them it's been ten years since then and the siblings managed to gather many signatures with Neptune and Shirahoshi appealing to the masses even through the island been battling discrimination for 16 years. Jinbe closes by taking responsibility for Arlong, claiming he wanted to stop him if he heard he was doing any ill-doing but the Marines Arlong had bought off kept information from reaching Marine Headquarters thus Jinbe did not know of his actions. Sanji angrily demands that Jinbe do seppuku (suicide) to atone for his mistake, but Nami stops him. Even though Jinbe is humbly willing to take any punishment from her, she states that she does not blame him, only Arlong, and that Jinbe is a friend of Luffy's.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
