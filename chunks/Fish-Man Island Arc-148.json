{"content": "Back at the plaza, it is revealed that the princes were beaten by the pirates and are now tied up alongside Neptune. They apologize to their father who reassures them that it is not their fault since the pirates' dependence on the energy steroids is only granting them false strength. Hody's crew call for their immediate execution, but Hody refuses as he does not know the status of Shirahoshi. Manboshi yells at him to leave her alone since she does not have anything to do with him, but Hody rebuffs that and says he knew her secret all along. One of the pirates call out to Hody who reveals they captured Jinbe and Shirahoshi who had fallen for the fake Neptune trap. With all his captives now in place, Hody laughs to himself that the only thing left is the Straw Hats who he figures have gone to the palace to rescue their friends. And even if they get to the plaza, he made preparations for them. Out come 100,000 outlaws (70,000 fish-men and 30,000 captive humans) who surround the plaza ready to fight.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
