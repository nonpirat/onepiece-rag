{"content": "The tsunamis are right above the heads of the Marines as they begin to panic (though Doflamingo is more excited than scared). Aokiji suddenly vanishes from his seat and uses Ice Age to freeze the waves before they crash down on the base. He then goes to attack Whitebeard, but the pirate captain easily stops the attack with an airquake, hitting the Admiral in the process and shattering him. Aokiji re-forms himself at the edge of the bay and uses his powers to freeze it as well. With the bay now frozen, Whitebeard's ships are unable to move, and the Marines begin to bombard them with cannon fire. The pirate captains respond in kind by charging out onto the now-frozen bay to do battle. The Vice Admirals quickly meet them, and the fighting quickly reaches chaotic levels.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
