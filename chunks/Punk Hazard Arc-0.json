{"content": "Punk Hazard Arc(Chapters 654 to 699, Volumes 66 to 70)\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nAs the Straw Hats leave from Fish-Man Island, the crew has some free time. Nami decides to spend hers having a bath, using a new Shower Tempo as a shower with Chopper (and unknown to her, Sanji and Brook) looking on. Meanwhile, the rest of the crew has decided to go fishing. Luffy knocks out one fish but it just attracts a bigger one, and that fish attracts an even bigger eel. Zoro kills it, but the weight of the fish brings the ship to a stop. To make matters worse, an underwater maelstrom, called the White Strom, suddenly appears in front of them. The eel gets sucked into it dragging the Thousand Sunny into it.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
