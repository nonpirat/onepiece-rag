{"content": "With their bargaining chip gone, the Marines rush the pirates, who attack in kind. The real Luffy wonders what the heck is going on as his fake self quickly loses control of the situation. If that is not bad enough, the Pacifistas arrive and begin shooting at the pirates. Doughty is caught in the blast and knocked out, shocking the pirates how an 88,000,000 bounty did not stand a chance. They soon start calling for \"Luffy\" to help them. But the Fake Straw Hats and he are fleeing the scene, knowing they do not stand a chance. It does them little good as they are confronted by Sentomaru and a Pacifista. The pirates believe that Fake Luffy will easily defeat them. Fake Luffy nervously tries to threaten the Marine captain but is quickly hammered into the ground and taken out, much to his crew's surprise.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Return to Sabaody Arc.txt", "title": "Return to Sabaody Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 598 to 602"}}
