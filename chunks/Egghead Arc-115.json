{"content": "Inside, York has been defeated, chained down and surrounded by the Straw Hats, Bonney, Vegapunk and Lucci with Zoro holding her at blade point while Usopp holds up the Den Den Mushi for her to make the call. The entire group heard everything and now know the context of the situation as York whines for the Elder Stars to beat them for her.\n\nTo the surprise of everyone, Luffy then picks up the call, introducing himself to the Five Elders while simultaneously confirming that he and his crew are allies of Dr. Vegapunk, and tells the Elders that if they care for York's safety, they should call off their fleet. Mars then asks Luffy who else is with him, but before he can reveal any more information, the call is ended by Robin, who angrily retorts at Luffy, telling him they cannot give their enemy too much information to which Luffy apologizes, asking if they will back down, but Usopp only tells him that this would be a dream.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
