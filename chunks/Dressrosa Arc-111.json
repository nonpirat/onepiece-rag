{"content": "Zoro grabbed onto the King's Plateau, satisfied as he then remembered what Mihawk had told him about using Haki during his training. He went up to praise from Usopp and the people around him, but told them not to be happy until the cage fell, and Doldo led the citizens down to help those in the streets. Meanwhile, the dwarves successfully destroyed the SMILE Factory, and Trebol was confident that Mansherry could help restore it, unaware that she, Leo, and Kabu were with Kyros, Rebecca, and Robin on the Flower Field. Elsewhere, Koala requested assistance from Sabo, saying that Luffy's life was possibly in danger. On top of the palace, Doflamingo and Trebol brutally overwhelmed Law, but Law remained defiant until Doflamingo tried to finish him off by shooting him. Down below, Bellamy continued to stand by Doflamingo and attack Luffy. Luffy finally ended the fight by punching Bellamy into the ground, and Bellamy silently thanked him for allowing him to maintain his convictions as Luffy went up to the palace", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
