{"content": "Meanwhile, Kin'emon was confronted by some Donquixote Pirates who recognized him. Elsewhere, Zoro caught up to the fairy and grabbed Shusui on top of a building but was flung off the roof and was hit by a falling millstone. However, he spotted and caught the fairy who had stolen his sword. The fairy was actually Wicca of the Tontatta, who told him to take her to her commander on the Flower Hill. She revealed that she had seen the Donquixote Pirates go to attack the Sunny, and Zoro initially raced toward the Sunny, but with no ability to get there, he was forced to go along with Wicca to the Flower Field. As he ran, he discovered that Doflamingo's crew had been keeping tabs on them the entire time.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
