{"content": "On Onigashima, Kaidou and the Beasts Pirates were on high alert as the Big Mom Pirates were approaching Wano Country on the Queen Mama Chanter. They had attached the Chanter to the giant carp to pull them up the waterfall. However, King then flew in with the power of the Ryu Ryu no Mi, Model: Pteranodon and crashed into the ship, sending it falling back down the waterfall, with Big Mom falling into the ocean in the process. The rest of the Big Mom Pirates landed safely on the Chanter, and they wondered what would become of Big Mom. Some of them were worried that Kaidou would kill her, as the two Emperors hated each other after once being crewmates.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
