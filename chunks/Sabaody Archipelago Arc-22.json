{"content": "No sooner than they leave the group, a Pirate Captain runs through the town, begging the citizens to remove a collar from his neck. He pleas that he's given up on the new world and just wants to leave, even claiming he has a wife and child, the latter whose never even seen him since he was a baby. Hatchan, however, tells the group not to help him as he is a slave of the World Nobles. After mentioning this fact, the collar activates and blows up the captain though he surprisingly survives still feebly begging to leave while a shadowed figure holding an axe and bounty poster identifies the captain from above a building. Two nobles, Rosward and his daughter, Shalria, show up afterwards causing everyone to bow as they pass. After their dog Saru urinates on the charred captain, Shalria kicks him before shooting him with a pistol, Luffy nearly attacks them after seeing this, but Hatchan stops him. Rosward and she then casually walk away talking buying another slave.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
