Shaka questions Lucci what their mission is to Egghead which Lucci bluntly answers that it was to kill Vegapunk and the Satellites. Also putting Stussy on his hitlist for her earlier betrayal. Seeing that they likely have no choice, Luffy agrees to free them, with one condition \"After we've stopped all four of them, you better not go after my friends and the Vegapunks just because you can't beat me in a fight.\" But Lucci replies, saying that he would kill Luffy before going after his crew. the two CP0 agents are freed and work together with Luffy and Zoro to fight the Seraphim.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
