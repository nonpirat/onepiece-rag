{"content": "In the skies around Onigashima, Momonosuke has finally taken flight, however, due to his fear of heights, he refused to open his eyes as he flew. This ended up making him crash straight into the castle and straight through the Performance Floor, before ascending into the second and then third floor, before managing to get back outside, briefly shocking everyone who saw him in the process.
