{"content": "On Peach Island of the Kamabakka Kingdom, Sanji (having somehow snapped out of Okama trance) is trying to convince the recently returned Ivankov that he is part of Luffy's crew, having read Iva helped him during the Marineford War. Iva does not believe him due to his bounty poster and Sanji constantly saying the name is his, but the picture is not. Getting nowhere, Sanji tries to fight Ivankov so he can steal a boat, but is quickly beaten down. Iva eventually decides to let him know Luffy's current status via the recent newspaper, to which he reacts with shock. Inazuma tells Iva he has a call from Baltigo, where Dragon and his men are currently residing. Iva worries about his whole identity being public knowledge, but Dragon assures him that it just put his followers at ease knowing that he is human. Dragon comments that soon it'll be time to gather their leaders since the death of Whitebeard is changing the world and the government. Iva however is curious on what happened to their former member, Kuma.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
