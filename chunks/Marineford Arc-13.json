{"content": "Whitebeard, however, claims that he was the one who let him go hunt down Blackbeard. When Ace calls him a liar, the other Whitebeard Pirates all agree with their captain and vow to save Ace no matter what. Suddenly, a shaking is felt throughout the island, which Garp explains is caused by Whitebeard's seaquakes which produced tsunamis that are headed right back at Marineford. This is due to Whitebeard's Devil Fruit, the Gura Gura no Mi, which allows him to make earthquakes. Sengoku warns the Marines that military force alone will not be enough to stop Whitebeard, as he has the power to destroy the world itself. As the tidal wave closes in on the base and the world watches on, it is revealed that forty-seven pirate ships led by Whitebeard face off against the Marine Headquarters and the Warlords of the Sea. Regardless of who wins, the current era of piracy is coming to an end.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
