{"content": "Meanwhile, Chopper and Carrot found themselves in the Mirro-World, and Chopper told Carrot to follow his lead as he sought to use the mirrors connected to Whole Cake Island to their advantage. However, they were soon chased by Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, and they briefly got in contact with Luffy and Nami with a mirror shard before it was shattered. Br\u00fbl\u00e9e eventually captured them, but accidentally turned a frog into the mirror image of Carrot and captured the frog. She brought Chopper and the frog to her house and prepared to cook the latter, and Carrot hid in the attic. Guests gathered at Br\u00fbl\u00e9e's house, among them being Randolph, the Noble Croc, and Diesel. When the party prepared to cook the frog, Carrot climbed down on the rope holding her duplicate and kicked over the giant pot of boiling water onto Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. She and Chopper then quickly defeated the rest of the guests, and captured Br\u00fbl\u00e9e and Diesel to guide them through the Mirro-World.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Whole Cake Island Arc.txt", "title": "Whole Cake Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 825 to 902"}}
