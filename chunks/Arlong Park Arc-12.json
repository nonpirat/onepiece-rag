{"content": "Sanji fights Kuroobi, but is nearly defeated when he goes into the water to rescue Luffy. However, seeing that Nojiko and Genzo are helping Luffy, Sanji brings Kuroobi up to dry land and defeats him. Meanwhile, Usopp fights Chew outside of Arlong Park. At first, he fakes his defeat so Chew will leave him alone. However, remembering the others fighting for Nami's sake, Usopp gains the courage to take him on and eventually defeats Chew by drenching him with alcohol and lighting him on fire, before repeatedly bashing his head with his hammer until he is knocked out.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Arlong Park Arc.txt", "title": "Arlong Park Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 69 to 95"}}
