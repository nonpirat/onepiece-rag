{"content": "Elizabello went up to Zoro as the latter fought Pica, offering the help of his King Punch. Zoro had no use for it at the moment, but told him to save it up. On the King's Plateau, as Viola revealed that most of the Donquixote Pirates had been taken down, Doldo prepared to go down to assist the citizens in peril, which Fujitora was currently doing. Meanwhile, Pica went up to the Flower Field to confront Kyros, and he asked the gladiator about his thoughts on King Riku. Kyros replied that everyone on Dressrosa wanted him to return to the throne once Doflamingo was taken down, and Pica went down to attack the injured gladiators. As Zoro went after him, Pica told him that he was going to assert Doflamingo's rule by killing Doldo and everyone on the King's Plateau. He then reinhabited his giant golem and walked to the King's Plateau, and Zoro had to quickly think of a plan to catch up to him as cannon fire failed to harm the stone man.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
