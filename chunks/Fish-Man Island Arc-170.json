Hody calls out to Surume, \"congratulating\" him on capturing Shirahoshi before threatening the Kraken that he could go up North where his brothers are and kill them if he continues to disobey. Upon hearing this, Surume starts to squeeze Shirahoshi but Luffy overhears this as well and asks Surume if that is the reason, he was answering to Hody. Visibly understanding his plight, Luffy tells Surume that he will protect them too which Surume starts to hesitate upon hearing. With that, Luffy starts to head for Hody. Ikaros Much and Dosun go to intercept him but are knocked aside by Zoro and Sanji. Hody orders his pirates to stop Luffy, but Luffy disappears from their sight and reappears in front of Hody, kicking him in the face with a furious expression.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
