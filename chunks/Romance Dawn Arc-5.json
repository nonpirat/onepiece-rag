{"content": "Later, the Red Hair Pirates were preparing to leave Foosha Village for good. Luffy had decided that he would not try to join them and declared that he would form his own crew that would be stronger than Shanks', find the greatest treasure, and become the Pirate King. To take Luffy up on his word, Shanks gave him his straw hat and told him to return it once he had surpassed him. As the Red Hair Pirates set sail, Shanks and Beckman both anticipated Luffy doing big things in the future.\n\nTen years later, Luffy set sail on his own in a small rowboat. The Lord of the Coast came to confront him, and he quickly took it out with Gomu Gomu no Pistol, where he stretched his arm forward and unleashed a long-range punch. As he drifted out to sea, Luffy plotted to recruit at least 10 crewmates, make a Jolly Roger, and become the Pirate King. However, he quickly ran into trouble as his boat was pulled into a whirlpool with no way of escaping.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Romance Dawn Arc.txt", "title": "Romance Dawn Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1 to 7"}}
