{"content": "Suddenly, Kuma lets loose an Ursus Shock from his Nikyu Nikyu powers, creating a tremendous explosion that wounds Little Oars Jr. greatly. Ace looks on in horror, begging him to stop knowing that Little Oars Jr.'s size makes him an easy target and that he would never make it. As Little Oars Jr. reels from the damage, he remembers when Ace made him a conical straw hat to help keep his head shaded in the sun and his head dry during rainy and snowy weather. Oars Jr. is more than grateful for the gift, which is why he is determined to save Ace.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
