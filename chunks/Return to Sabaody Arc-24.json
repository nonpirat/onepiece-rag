It does, revealing he is a lowly-26,000,000 Bounty pirate named \"Three-Tongued\" Demaro Black. Their ruse exposed, the rest of the Fake Straw Hats make a run for it while their now-former subordinates are outraged at being deceived. The real Luffy quickly figures out what's going on too, though he comments that \"Zoro\" and \"Sanji\" looked like the real deal. Sentomaru orders the arrest of every pirate there, commenting that he knows the real Luffy is in the crowd and has his Pacifista aimed for him.\n\nLuffy manages to jump away as the other pirates are caught in the blast. However, his disguise is knocked off, revealing himself to everyone in the area. The Fakes foam at the mouth when they realize they had actually threatened the real deal. The Marine quickly runs, while Sentomaru confronts Luffy, ordering his Pacifista to fire another shot.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Return to Sabaody Arc.txt", "title": "Return to Sabaody Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 598 to 602"}}
