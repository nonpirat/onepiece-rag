{"content": "Back on the Nostra Castello, Sanji and Bege argued over whether or not to poison the cake, and Sanji fed Bege his whipped cream to convince him not to. The cake was then completed, and the pirates and chefs celebrated. Meanwhile, Big Mom caught up to the Sunny on Prometheus, who threatened to burn the ship and crew up. However, she then smelled the cake on the approaching Nostra Castello, and headed toward it while Pudding and Sanji went to the Sunny. The Sunny crew then headed for Cacao Island, and Smoothie's fleet pursued them while Perospero followed Big Mom and the Fire Tank Pirates, who took the cake to Liqueur Island to get it far away from the Straw Hats. Perospero feared that the Fire Tank Pirates had poisoned the cake, and was consumed with paranoia. Meanwhile, on Cacao Island, Oven had every mirror destroyed except one, had a fleet besiege the island, and gathered thousands of his crewmates to lie in wait to ambush Luffy and the Straw Hats.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Whole Cake Island Arc.txt", "title": "Whole Cake Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 825 to 902"}}
