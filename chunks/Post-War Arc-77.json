{"content": "In East Blue, under Tequila Wolf's bridge, Nico Robin accepts the Revolutionaries' offer to meet Dragon at Baltigo. She teases the revolutionaries, stating that if she had known they had such groups, she would have had them come earlier. When she rides the ship that the Revolutionaries use to go to Baltigo, she refuses to go inside and stays on the ship's balcony, even in the harsh weather, for she states that she does not like the idea of being invited into a room with no escape, to which the Revolutionaries respond that their intentions bear no malice. Since she does not accept the invitation to go inside, the Revolutionaries prepare her warm food and drinks, blankets, windshields, and a sofa on the balcony of the ship. Robin thinks that going to her captain's father could make her stronger and states that this is the first time she wanted to become stronger for someone else.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
