{"content": "The story flashes back to a few hours earlier, when Hody Jones and Vander Decken IX were teaming up. Decken goes on to demonstrate his Mato Mato ability. Before he can pick a volunteer, Hatchan appears and objects to the operation. The octopus fish-man then questions why Hyouzou and Decken are going along with the plan when they did not answer Arlong's call when he formed his crew. Hyouzou answers that Arlong was too cheap to afford him at the time and that he only cares about money and not the cause of his employers. Decken answers that Arlong tried to make him his underling, which Decken did not take kindly to. Hody then explains that while he respected Arlong, he was too barbaric in his methods, and thus the New Fish-Man Pirates have apparently learned from their mistakes and prepared. When the subject of Luffy being on the island is brought up, Hatchan explains that Luffy saved his life and that he owes him since Luffy is his friend.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
