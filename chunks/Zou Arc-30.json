{"content": "The samurai and some of the Straw Hats went outside, where the samurai surveyed Zou's destruction and wept. They were called back inside by Nekomamushi, who said that Robin was nearly finished translating the Poneglyph. Inside, Robin and Nami realized that the Poneglyph's message more resembled a map, and Inuarashi revealed that this was a Road Poneglyph. There were four Road Poneglyphs that each led to an island. If all four islands were discovered, the location of Laugh Tale could be found. Of the other three, one was lost while the other two were kept by Big Mom and Kaidou. Luffy was excited to find this out, even though two of them were being kept by the Emperor, since he had always intended to take them down. Zoro inquired how the minks knew so much about Poneglyphs, and the two rulers revealed that the Kozuki Family was a family of stonemasons who invented the Poneglyph 800 years ago. However, the knowledge of how to read and write the language on Poneglyphs ended with Oden, who was executed by Kaidou", "metadata": {"source": "database/Zou Arc.txt", "title": "Zou Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 802 to 824"}}
