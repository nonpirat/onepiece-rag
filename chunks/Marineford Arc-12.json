{"content": "After some time, Ace was nominated as the Second Division Commander; during this time, he met Blackbeard, who suggested he take the job. Before he accepted, Ace revealed his past to Whitebeard, who laughed it off despite his rivalry with Gol D. Roger, claiming everyone was a child of the sea. Then the incident with Blackbeard killing Thatch happened, and Ace, in anger, swore to go after him.\n\nWhitebeard and the others tried to talk him out of it, with the former getting an uneasy feeling about everything. However, Ace persisted, as Blackbeard was from his division and Thatch was his friend. He also wanted to take responsibility for Blackbeard's disgraceful actions. Back in the present, Ace pleads with the others to simply leave him behind, claiming his own cockiness was the cause of his own capture.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
