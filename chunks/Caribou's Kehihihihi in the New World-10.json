{"content": "However, the celebration is cut short as a powerful dinosaur suddenly appears and attacks, injuring Caribou. The dinosaur is then revealed to be the Worst Generation member, X Drake, who is now another subordinate of Kaidou's. After defeating Caribou and the others, Drake then starts dragging away the commander back to Kaidou's base. Before he departs from the island, Gaburu's grandmother grants Caribou one final meat pie to take with him while his crew and the revolutionaries tearfully salute him. As he leaves on Drake's ship, Caribou bids farewell to everyone as they cry for him. Gaburu's grandmother also cries, but smiles as she recalls how Caribou defended her from Drake. She then visits the real Gaburu's grave, which has Caribou's wanted poster tacked on it, on a cliff while thanking Caribou for showing the same kindness as her grandson did, revealing that she knew all along that Gaburu was dead and that Caribou was an imposter, much to the shock of Coribou and the rest of the crew.\n\nStory Impact", "metadata": {"source": "database/Caribou's Kehihihihi in the New World.txt", "title": "Caribou's Kehihihihi in the New World", "Chapters": "Chapters 674 to 731"}}
