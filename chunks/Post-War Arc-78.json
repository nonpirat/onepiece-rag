{"content": "Meanwhile, in Karakuri, the marines led by Captain Gorilla investigate the \"Nightmare of Baldimore\" incident and have information that Cyborg Franky might be behind it, but question how he could arrive on the island while there is no report of the arrival of an icebreaker ship. Meanwhile, in the kingdom's mountains, Franky locates another laboratory whose entrance was exposed after the explosion. Inside, he finds blueprints, but instead of cultural creations, these blueprints are about weapons, ranging from battleships to human cells. Franky decides to live there and become stronger, leaving the mountain once in a while to get some cola from his companions' house. Due to his wrecked face scaring his friends, Franky decides to wear a tiger fur rug, but after lighting a fireplace, Franky's tiger fur gets caught on fire, causing him to run wild and scaring the marines investigating the area, making them think he is a beast. That incident was later called the \"Legend of the Sacred Burning Beast of Baldimore,\"", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
