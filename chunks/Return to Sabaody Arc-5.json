{"content": "Meanwhile, over at Grove 13 and Shakky's Bar, Sanji has arrived and found out that Zoro arrived on the island first. Franky arrived ten days later and made his way to the Thousand Sunny, which had been guarded by Duval and his men, for which Sanji expressed gratitude. Sanji also learns that Nami, Usopp, Chopper, and Brook have arrived as well. This leaves Luffy and Robin as the only two unaccounted for. Rayleigh, who is also present in the bar, states that he only trained Luffy for a year and a half before leaving him and has not seen him since.\n\nIn another part of the island, Robin, who has recently arrived, discovers that she is being followed by unknown men and is perplexed by Brook's concert and the Straw Hats' recruitment of new members.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Return to Sabaody Arc.txt", "title": "Return to Sabaody Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 598 to 602"}}
