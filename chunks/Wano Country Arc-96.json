{"content": "After they set out, Oden and his retainers were joined by Shinobu, who had always wanted to serve the Kozuki Family. Oden learned from Kaidou that he had placed a spy in the Flower Capital and that they had purposely made Oden dance because he was too strong at that time for Kaidou and his allies, thus weakening him and increasing their chances of victory. Oden and the Scabbards fought a ferocious battle against Kaidou and his crew in the Udon region. In the battle, Oden was able to inflict a scar on Kaidou's chest, but before he could take Kaidou out, he was tricked by Higurashi who transformed into Momonosuke and thus Oden was struck down by Kaidou. Soon after, all of his retainers were taken down as well and the battle ended with Oden and his retainers defeated. They were all imprisoned in the Flower Capital and sentenced to execution in three days by being boiled alive.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
