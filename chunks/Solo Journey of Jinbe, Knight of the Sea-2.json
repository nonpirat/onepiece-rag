Jinbe goes along with a local to see a large amount of offerings missing from their designated spot, which deepens the mystery. Almost immediately after, both the sea dog officer and his home fall onto the ruins, much to Jinbe's shock. He spots a shadow retreating back into the ocean and realizes that the culprit is definitely underwater, so he gives chase.
