{"content": "Back inside, Hancock's group have finally reached Ace's cell, allowing the Warlord to meet Luffy's brother face to face. As the two talk, the prisoners of the floor begin to leer and make cat calls toward her. This drives on the nerves of Magellan until he suddenly unveils the full extent of his Devil Fruit powers, literally dripping himself with poison and forming a hydra from the globs. One of the prisoners tries to calm him down, to which Magellan responds by covering the prisoner with poison. Magellan reminds the prisoners that he can and will kill them anytime if they get out of line. Hancock then concludes her business of delivering the news to Ace that Luffy has come to rescue him, much to his surprise, by using Magellan as a distraction.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
