She proceeds to stomp on the helpless Pythagoras and destroy him before turning her attention to Franky. Robin's group hear the noise from building A and worry for their friends' safety, Atlas then remembers the abandoned research section and leads Robin and Chopper to the area of the lab. Meanwhile Sanji takes over the fight against S-Shark, the latter who cannot seem to harm him thanks to Sanji's new awakened Germa enhancements, while Nami and Brook tend to Edison.\n\nLuffy's group find that the Seraphim will not let their flames go out to harm them. In addition, S-Hawk disappeared which Lucci presumed is to deal with the weaker targets first. Zoro took off to go find him, with Luffy ordering Kaku to follow after to make sure he does not get lost while Lucci and he continue to fight S-Bear. Elsewhere, Bonney continued to cry over Kuma's memories.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
