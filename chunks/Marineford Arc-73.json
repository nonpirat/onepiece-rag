{"content": "Ivankov admonishes the collapsed Luffy, who had asked for another dosage of Tension Hormones. Ivankov states that Luffy had been through too much over the course of Impel Down to then, and that pushing himself any further would mean throwing his life away. Luffy states that he will do whatever he can, even if he dies, as being unable to fight and failing to save Ace would make him want to die anyway. Ivankov chides Luffy, stating that if Luffy dies, then he would be unable to face Dragon ever again. Despite this, Ivankov tells Luffy that he can have it \"his own damned way,\" injecting him with another shot of Tension Hormones. Empowered once more, Luffy stands up and lets out a scream of resolve.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
