{"content": "- Skypiea's existence gives a new vision of world geography. As explained by Gan Fall and Captain McKinley, there are more sky islands. For example, at the end of the Sabaody Archipelago Arc, Kuma sent Nami off to Weatheria. During the Dressrosa Arc, Urouge is seen resting in Ballon Terminal, a city located on a sky island.\n\t- Urouge sees Kaidou jumping off Ballon Island and surviving, a feat that would essentially highlight Kaidou's apparent inability to die.\n- The golden city Shandora is confirmed to actually exist, legitimizing the claims of Mont Blanc Noland and the beliefs of his descendant Mont Blanc Cricket. It is revealed that the city, along with a large part of Jaya, became lost by being sent up into the sky by a Knock Up Stream.\n\t- Cricket discovers the truth upon hearing the Shandoran Golden Belfry Bell ringing, bringing an end to the Saruyama Alliance's expedition.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Skypiea Arc.txt", "title": "Skypiea Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 237 to 302"}}
