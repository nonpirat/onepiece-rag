{"content": "The Princess' bath time is soon announced and the Amazons in the castle are forced to leave and set up a perimeter around it, not allowing anyone in. One of the younger Amazons asks Ran (who is part of Hancock's pirate crew) why they do the routine every day. Ran answers that in the past, there was a gorgon in the center of the sea that the Boa sisters managed to defeat. However, in its death, it placed a curse on the three in the form of its large eyes on their backs. If anyone were to see these eyes, they would turn to stone and therefore the castle is emptied and surrounded to supposedly protect the Amazons from this curse.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Amazon Lily Arc.txt", "title": "Amazon Lily Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 514 to 524"}}
