{"content": "Crocodile dares Vivi to try and help her friends and he floods the room, lets Bananawani in, and has one swallow the key. However, he suddenly gets a phone call by a Mr. Prince, recognized by the crew as Sanji, who starts off by imitating the phone call in Little Garden. Sanji makes Crocodile believe he got caught in front of the Rain Dinners and Crocodile goes to check out the situation in front of the casino. Chopper acts as a decoy, using his powers to avoid Crocodile while Sanji destroys the bridge between the Rain Dinners and the rest of Rainbase to ensure that Crocodile cannot return to Rain Dinners right away. With Smoker's suggestion, Sanji kicks the right Bananawani with the key, making it cough up both the key and a large wax ball.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Arabasta Arc.txt", "title": "Arabasta Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 155 to 217"}}
