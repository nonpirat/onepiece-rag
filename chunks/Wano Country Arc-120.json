{"content": "The Red Scabbards managed to penetrate Kaidou's skin, causing the Emperor to be extremely confused by it. After the Scabbards fell into the Live Stage's ground floor with Kaidou, the alliance finally showed itself to their enemies. Nami and Carrot managed to free themselves as Big Mom came into Luffy's way. The Straw Hat captain declared that he would not only emerge victorious against Kaidou, but also Big Mom and Orochi, declaring an all-out war. Kaidou began to coldly analyze the steps that the samurai had followed up to that moment thanks to the Straw Hat Pirates, accepting Luffy's proposal of a war without quarter. After transforming into a dragon and flying off, the Red Scabbards clung to the beast and flew with him to the top of Onigashima, where Nekomamushi affirmed that they knew they would get there, so they had brought all the minks, just below the full moon.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
