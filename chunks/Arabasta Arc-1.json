{"content": "The Going Merry is on its way to Arabasta and the crew is trying to catch fish to eat. Vivi explains that Crocodile is seen as a hero in Arabasta and that no one suspects that he plans to take over the kingdom. Suddenly, they steer through a hot spot (an undersea volcano making the sea above steaming hot), Usopp and Luffy catch Mr. 2, who coincidentally took a similar course, on their fishing rods. The crew pulls him up and quickly befriend him, mainly due to how entertaining he is, especially with his ability to transform into other people with the Mane Mane no Mi. He imitates everybody on the ship except Sanji, who was cooking at the moment, and Vivi, who he simply did not touch. Bon Kurei is then picked up by his own ship and crew and leaves, swearing on friendship. Just as they leave, Vivi realizes that he is Mr. 2 of Baroque Works, but the Straw Hats see it as good fortune to have met him and wear white bandages on their lower arms so they will know if Bon Kurei is imitating one of them.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Arabasta Arc.txt", "title": "Arabasta Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 155 to 217"}}
