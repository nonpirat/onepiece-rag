He unsheathes his sword and lets out a tremendous slash that heads straight for the Moby Dick. However, before it can be hit, Jozu, the Third Division Commander of the Whitebeard Pirates, who lives up to his title by covering himself in diamond, intercepts it. Kizaru suddenly make his move, appearing in the air and firing down an array of light beams at Whitebeard. But this was also intercepted, this time by First Division Commander Marco, who is covered in blue flames after the attack. Marco states that Whitebeard cannot be taken on the first turn, prompting Kizaru to remark on how scary the Whitebeard Pirates are.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
