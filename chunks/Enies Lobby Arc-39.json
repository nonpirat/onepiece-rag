{"content": "Lucci found Luffy and began to attack him. However, right before Lucci could strike the finishing blow, the damage from the Gear 3 attack starts to hurt. As he struggled with the pain, Luffy returned to normal. In the tunnels, Zoro and the others slowly drown. As they neared death, Kokoro saved them all by revealing her true identity as a mermaid.\n\nRobin and Franky hijacked Spandam's escape ship, and Kokoro soon arrived, jumping into the ship with the unconscious Straw Hat crew. Robin and Franky thank her as she changed back into a human and their friends woke up, but they realized they still need to wait for Luffy.\n\nMeanwhile, Oimo and Kashii, who had been carrying Zambai, Mozu and Kiwi, the rest of the Franky Family, Paulie, Lulu, Tilestone, Sodom, Gomorrah, and Yokozuna out of the path of the Buster Call, finally reached the exit of Enies Lobby. However, they are attacked by three Buster Call ships; hit by cannon fire, the Straw Hats' allies tumbled into the waterfall below.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Enies Lobby Arc.txt", "title": "Enies Lobby Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 375 to 430"}}
