{"content": "Little Oars Jr. quickly begins to fight his way to the plaza where Ace is being held. He destroys one of the Marine battleships in the process, giving a path to his fellow pirates. The Marines are forced to fall back to strengthen their defenses. Whitebeard, however, disapproves of Little Oars Jr. recklessly charging in, but Little Oars Jr. begs him to let him do as he pleases to save Ace. Whitebeard relents and orders his men to back him up as Little Oars Jr. continues to get closer to the execution stand. Meanwhile, Hancock attacks a group of pirates with her Mero Mero powers, managing to turn the body parts she hits to stone and breaking them off in the process with her amazing agility. However, she not only attacks pirates but Marines as well. When asked by a bewildered Marine, Hancock states that while she agreed to join the battle, she never allied herself with the Marines. To her, all men are alike, except for Luffy. She then tells the Marines that they must consider her promise to the Marines", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
