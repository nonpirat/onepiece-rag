{"content": "Meanwhile, Luffy captured several animals that Br\u00fbl\u00e9e had turned into mirror duplicates of his comrades, including Sanji and Pudding. As night fell, he realized that he had captured the real Nami, and after freeing her, they talked with Pound, who revealed how Br\u00fbl\u00e9e had created the disguised animals and what had happened to Chopper. Pound then told them how homies were created by scattering a month's worth of lifespan given by the citizens of Totto Land every six months as a tribute, as Big Mom was able to remove lifespans with the power of her Devil Fruit. Pound then revealed that he was once one of Big Mom's husbands, but had been cast aside after giving her twin daughters. Right then, Charlotte Cracker, the tenth son of the Charlotte Family and one of the Big Mom Pirates' Three Sweet Commanders, pulled Pound out of the ground and prepared to kill him for giving information to their enemies. Pound pleaded with Cracker to let him see his daughters, Chiffon and Lola, before he died.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Whole Cake Island Arc.txt", "title": "Whole Cake Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 825 to 902"}}
