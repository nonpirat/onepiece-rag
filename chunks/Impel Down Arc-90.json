{"content": "Meanwhile, Luffy's group are plowing through Level 2 and dealing with the creatures on the said level when Luffy notices that Magellan is not behind them anymore. Bon informs him of Iva and Inazuma's efforts to stall him which nearly prompts Luffy to turn back. Bon, however, convinces him to keep going and to believe in their power. Meanwhile, Crocodile and Jinbe notice the whole level devoid of prisoners and that their cells have been left open. Back on Level 3, it seems Iva has been hit in the face by Magellan's poison, but he reveals he's faking, having avoided the attack thanks to his heavy makeup. Magellan grows annoyed with his antic, so Iva proceeds to end it with his ultimate attack. On Level 2, Inazuma stands guard in front of the destroyed entrance when something burst into the room. He at first thinks it's Iva but much to his dismay, Magellan appears, wounded but still going. Inazuma proceeds to go on the attack with the cut-up stairs to buy some more time.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
