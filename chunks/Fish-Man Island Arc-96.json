{"content": "Back with the Sun Pirates, Tiger chastised Arlong and Jinbe for their brutal actions against their opponents. Jinbe stated that the Marines were trying to kill him, but Tiger firmly stated that he will not kill out of hatred and told his crew that his ultimate goal was to break the iron clad rules of the world and freeing the oppressed. Tiger went on saying that killing senselessly would just make them as bad as the humans that oppressed them. He also stated that if they started acting out of revenge, the humans will just respond in kind in an endless cycle. Arlong, however, suggested that they should kill humans to the point where they will fear fish-men and will not want to retaliate. Jinbe smacked Arlong on the head to shut him up.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
