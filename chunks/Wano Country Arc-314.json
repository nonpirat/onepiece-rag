When Robin reveals what she previously learned about Pluton in the Tomb of the Kings at the Arabasta Kingdom, Sukiyaki confirms to Robin that Pluton is indeed in Wano Country. Law joins them, and Sukiyaki shows them an underwater part of Wano and the original Wano Country located at the feet of Mt. Fuji. Sukiyaki confirms that Pluton rests below the ancient city and shows them the Road Poneglyph below the mountain.\n\t\t- Sukiyaki also asks Robin to keep his true identity a secret due to the shame he feels for being partly responsible for Orochi's rise to power as the Shogun. However, he later reveals his true identity to his grandchildren and reunites with Momonosuke and Hiyori. Sukiyaki states his intention to pass down his knowledge to Momonosuke before returning to seclusion.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
