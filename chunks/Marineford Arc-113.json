{"content": "- The Marineford Arc is probably by far the biggest turn of events in One Piece history as it features the first two\u00a0deaths of major characters in the current story line. In particular, the death of the Emperor Whitebeard, along with the resignation of two Warlords of the Sea (Jinbe and Teach) and one revoked (Moria), drastically altering the balance of the Three Great Powers.\n- Ace's father is revealed to be Gol D. Roger and more details come to light about how Ace became a member of the Whitebeard Pirates.\n- It is revealed to the world that Luffy is Dragon's son and Garp's grandson.\n- Ace is killed by Admiral Akainu, the third Admiral to be introduced, which causes Luffy to fall into a coma until he recovers in the Post-War Arc. Before his death, Ace mentioned Sabo, who is introduced in the flashbacks Luffy has after he awakes, and later plays a major role in the story.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
