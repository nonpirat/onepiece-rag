She corrects that she is more of a magician and her attack are just basic weather chemistry before attacking them with a move called Black Ball: Raiun Rod, streaming black clouds and whipping it at her opponents, shocking them. Ikaros Much is nearly caught in the radius triggering his \"dried squid\" reflex. Zeo and he surmise that Nami is the Straw Hats' weakness from Sanji's reaction and go to attack her. Zeo camouflaging himself and holding down her legs while Ikaros goes to stab her with his squid spears. Brook, seeing this, moves in and takes the attack (while also asking to see Nami's panties again earning him a punch to the face from her). Ikaros cites his spear will dry up all of Brook's moisture but as he is a skeleton and already all dried up, it does not work.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
