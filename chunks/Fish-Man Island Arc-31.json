{"content": "In the port town of Coral Hill, Luffy's group takes shelter in Madam Shyarly's Mermaid Cafe. Shyarly, a shortfin mako shark mermaid, provides them a room where they can treat Sanji. Fortunately, Luffy's group locates blood donors for Sanji. The group is relieved that Sanji regains consciousness. Horrified, Sanji finds out that his blood donors are two okama pirate twins named Splash and Splatter. Chopper then examines Luffy's arm and realizes that he was poisoned when he attacked Hammond's group. However, due to his encounter with Magellan, Luffy's body developed antibodies that fought against the poison, which saved his life. Luffy remarks that the octopus merman swordsman that was with Hammond blocked his attack and nicked him in the process, suggesting that he must be skilled.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
