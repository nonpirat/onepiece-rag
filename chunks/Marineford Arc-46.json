{"content": "Although Mihawk stands before him, Luffy knows he has no time to fight Mihawk, so he bursts past him with his superhuman speed. However, Hawk-Eyes, peering through the crowd, manages to find Luffy and swings his blade forward, slashing Luffy as well as all those between the two. After sending Luffy careening into a wall, Mihawk pursues him, attempting to impale him. However, two Newkama soldiers get in the way of Mihawk, who brushes them aside with little effort. Luffy attempts to attack Mihawk again, but realizing that the Warlord of the Sea would slice his arm off, he halts his attack at the last moment, instead choosing to run away. Mihawk comments that Luffy is unusually calm as he slices horizontally at the rubber man. Luffy dodges Mihawk's attack as it slices a frozen wave in to, with the upper half crashing down on Marineford,", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
