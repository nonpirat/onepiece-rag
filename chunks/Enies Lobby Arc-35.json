{"content": "15 years ago, an incident happened where 500 soldiers were captured on an island by pirates. The pirate\u2019s captain wanted to become the king of the island in return for sparing the soldiers' lives. Just as the island was about to fall, the World Government sent a boy to the island. The boy infiltrated the pirate's hideout and killed the 500 soldiers on the spot. The pirates, infuriated, began to shoot at the boy. The boy emerged from the explosions, killed the pirate's captain and ended the incident. That boy, at the age of 13, became a member of CP9, and has become the strongest killing machine since CP9\u2019s inception.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Enies Lobby Arc.txt", "title": "Enies Lobby Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 375 to 430"}}
