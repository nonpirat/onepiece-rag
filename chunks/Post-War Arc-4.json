{"content": "Elsewhere on Marineford, Donquixote Doflamingo and the Pacifista are beating Gecko Moria to death. Doflamingo claims that the government has decided that he is too weak to be a Warlord of the Sea, and that it would be better if he was thought to be \"killed in the war\" rather than eliminated by the government. Moria asks if Sengoku is behind the decision, but Doflamingo claims that the decision was made by powers even higher than him.\n\nTwo weeks later, the aftereffects of the war are still taking hold. In the town of Las Camp in the West Blue, a new pirate crew has formed, and its captain proclaims that they will head to the Grand Line. While the Marines are trying to stop them, new pirate crews are being formed all around the world.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
