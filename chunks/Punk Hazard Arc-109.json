Asking if the two women are satisfied and chiding Tashigi for being too slow, he approaches Monet admitting that there are things he will not cut before asking if she has ever met a wild animal that is guaranteed not to bite. Monet realizes he actually is going to attack her but is frozen in fear from his gaze to move. Zoro indeed cuts her in half but does not use Haki, thus she survives thanks to her Logia powers. However, Monet is still too terrified from fear to pull herself back together properly. One half of Monet's body manages to get up and attempts to stab Zoro in the back. However, Tashigi interferes and finishes her off, finally defeating the snow harpy.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
