{"content": "When Nami was a little girl, she and her older sister Nojiko lived with their adoptive mother, Bell-m\u00e8re. Although they were poor, they were happy, before Arlong came. Upon his arrival, he demanded that the citizens of the island pay him for their lives - 100,000 per adult, and 50,000 per child. Needless to say, Bell-m\u00e8re could not pay this fee, only being able to come up with 100,000. And, although the two little girls were hiding, she decided to sacrifice her own life so that they could live freely. Arlong agreed to Bell-m\u00e8re's terms, and killed her in front of the two little girls. Not only that, but Arlong decided to take Nami with him, deciding her cartography skills would be useful. Later, Nojiko found Nami at Bell-m\u00e8re's grave as she revealed to Nojiko that she made a deal with Arlong to buy back Cocoyasi Village for 100,000,000.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Arlong Park Arc.txt", "title": "Arlong Park Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 69 to 95"}}
