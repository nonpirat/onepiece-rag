{"content": "Meanwhile, Caribou has awakened from his beating and is searching for whomever took his treasure, commenting that if he brought back the secret of the Mermaid Princess and the treasure, he would gain bonus points with a certain someone. He comes upon the factory and sees Pekoms and Tamago leaving with said treasure, yelling for them to give it back. Pekoms checks his bounty lists and sees Caribou is currently worth 200,000,000 much to the citizen's shock. Caribou unveils a Gatling gun from his torso and fires at them. Pekoms is hit but reveals he has a Devil Fruit too which allows him to shield himself in a turtle shell. As Pekoms reforms and puts his clothes back on, Caribou pulls out a scythe and goes to strike him. But Pekoms hits him with a Haki infused punch and knocks him out instantly. It is then revealed that Pekoms has a 330,000,000 bounty on him. Tamago and him decide to head back to Big Mom.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
