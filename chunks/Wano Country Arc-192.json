{"content": "Elsewhere on the second floor, Usopp bluffed the Beasts Pirates, claiming responsibility for the blasts of Haoshoku Haki knocking out the enemy (which was actually being emanated from Big Mom who was fighting elsewhere on the floor), while dubbing himself \u201cUsohachi the Sibling Hunter\u201d, asserting that he was the one who defeated Page One and Ulti. This also distracted them from Tama and Nami, the latter who was attempting to communicate with her crewmates and learn their status. In the Right Brain Tower, Franky had reunited with the Heart Pirate allies, and were together preventing the Beasts Pirates from trying to enter the Performance Floor. On the Third Floor, Brook attempted to flee from the out-of-control flames, with an unconscious Robin in his arms, while Jinbe fought alongside the Kid Pirates on the fourth floor and the samurai blockaded the entrance to the Performance Floor.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
