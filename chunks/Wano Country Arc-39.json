{"content": "That morning, Chopper, Momonosuke, Tama, and Kiku walked down to Kuri Beach when they saw Big Mom washed ashore. Chopper became frantic while the other three wondered who she was. However, Big Mom revealed herself to have no memory of who she was. A day later, Chopper's group brought Big Mom to Okobore Town, where Tsuru served her some oshiruko. Big Mom took a liking to the oshiruko, and Chopper told her that there was lots of it in Udon to get her to go there. Big Mom tamed a wanizame by hitting it, and the group rode it on their long journey to save Luffy. Momonosuke resumed practicing his sportsmanship, and shouted \"sunacchi\" after having heard Zoro tell him about it being used in his homeland. Kiku told him not to say it, as it was a cry used by past generations in Kuri that was unbefitting of someone of his status.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
