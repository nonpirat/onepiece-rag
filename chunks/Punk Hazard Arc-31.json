{"content": "The crew notices that the area looked destroyed due to explosives. The samurai reattaches himself to his legs, and it is explained to the crew that he is the reason the distress call was made due to him slicing up the centaurs, and that the distress call was actually meant for Brownbeard. The samurai says that he only did it to save his son, and that he sliced anybody that got in his way. He comes to the conclusion that his son must still be inside. It is then explained to Luffy that Law is now a Warlord of the Sea, much to Luffy's surprise. The samurai states that Law cut his body into pieces, and his legs accidentally ended up stuck to the dragon. It is also explained why it seemed like the legs could talk, which was due to the samurai's excessive farting. Brook then tells the group that he encountered the missing torso, but he ran away from it and does not know where it is.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Punk Hazard Arc.txt", "title": "Punk Hazard Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 654 to 699"}}
