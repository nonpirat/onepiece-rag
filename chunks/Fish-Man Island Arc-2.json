He jokingly comments \"maybe\" and then remembers when he first met Roger, who surprisingly looked very much like Luffy when he was younger, even wearing the same straw hat. Rayleigh then comments to Shakky that destiny is slowly taking shape and that Luffy has proven himself worthy of wearing that certain Straw Hat. He also mentions that it would not be a bad idea to live a bit longer.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
