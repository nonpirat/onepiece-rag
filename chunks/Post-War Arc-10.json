{"content": "Luffy is left with the bandits and quickly shows his disdain for them due to his previous encounter not too long ago. The bandits sit down to eat, and Luffy complains about the small portion he has gotten compared to Ace's, who gets a bigger share. Dadan explains that since Ace had slain the buffalo, he got the bigger meat, and that Luffy should count himself lucky that Ace is sharing with them. Dadan then tries to take advantage of Luffy and makes him her servant, but her attempts backfire due to Luffy's simple-minded nature. Ace heads off on his own, with Luffy following after him. Luffy tells him that he forgives him for spitting on him earlier and tries to be his friend. Ace, however, ignores him and knocks down a tree to prevent Luffy from following him.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
