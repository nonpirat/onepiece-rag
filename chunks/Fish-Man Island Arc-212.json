A fish-man starts to respond negatively to this but is stopped by Shyarly who tells them to just watch as the ones fighting for the island's sake are humans (though has to admit she does not know what some of them are when they ask about Brook).

Zeo still thinks the Straw Hats will die in the end but Brook counters that the Straw Hats believe Luffy will be the Pirate King and if they continue to do so, nothing will frighten them.
