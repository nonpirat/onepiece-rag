However, Doflamingo has no interest in the conflict or the slavery trade anymore and leaves it to Disco, effectively abandoning it. He also states that the Seven Warlords of the Sea have been called together to engage the Whitebeard Pirates.

Rayleigh replies that he is merely a simple coating-engineer now and warns not to use the former title as he would prefer to live", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
