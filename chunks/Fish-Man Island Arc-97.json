{"content": "That night, Tiger confided to Jinbe about what the difference he thought Otohime would see in Arlong and him and that the demons that dwell in his (Tiger's) heart was the truly terrifying one. And so it went, Otohime would try to get her subjects to sign her petition and Tiger and his Sun Pirates continued sailing the seas. Tiger and Jinbe soon received bounties of 230,000,000 and 76,000,000 respectively (which annoys Arlong that he was ignored by the Marines). Three years have passed since the Mary Geoise incident, and the Sun Pirates landed on an island where the natives request that they take a former slave named Koala with them to return her to her homeland. They explained that she managed to escape from Mary Geoise during Tiger's raid and ended up on their island.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
