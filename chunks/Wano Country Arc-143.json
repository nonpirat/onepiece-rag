{"content": "Back at Franky's battle, after a General Left failed to deter Sasaki, Franky managed to catch him by the horn and then flip over the dinosaur. Just as Franky was going to follow up on that attack, Sasaki's men restrained the robot. However, thanks to Usopp, Nami and Tama appearing with a horde of \"tamed\" Gifters in tow, Franky managed to break free. At this point, Ulti and Page One appeared in pursuit of the three, revealing to Sasaki that the Gifters were being turned against them. Ulti attempted to attack Nami, but the Cat Burglar countered with a Thunder Lance Tempo, though it did not keep the dinosaur woman down for long. In the meantime, Usopp used Kibi Dan-boshi to shoot dangos into Sasaki's men mouths, turning them into the alliance's allies. While the triceratops was distracted by this turn of events, Franky kicked his head upwards, to unleash a Shori no V-Flash at his belly.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
