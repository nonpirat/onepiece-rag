However, a massive wall was built around the island for unknown reasons, with rainwater filling eventually all the way to the top of the walls, before overflowing. Land was established around the larger peak to form the current Wano, while the smaller peak became Onigashima. The trio then reached the bottom, in an underwater cavern, where Sukiyaki revealed the Road Poneglyph and claimed that Pluton was further ahead, though he never saw it himself. He then explained that to release Pluton, one needs to take down the walls protecting Wano, which is what \u201copening the country's borders\u201d truly meant.
