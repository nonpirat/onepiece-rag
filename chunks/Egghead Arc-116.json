{"content": "Saturn, having followed the call, then reaffirmed the three main objectives which the fleet needs to save: York, Punk Records and the Power Source which could fuel the Mother Flame, deeming anything below that expendable, even concerns by his underlining Doberman, who pointed out that several of their Cipher Pol Agents were still on the island, but Saturn dismissed the concerns, stating their lives would not matter if they achieved their goals, as they could be simply replaced. While waiting outside, Saturn then received the information gathered by Rob Lucci, discussing what he had learned with Kizaru. Saturn asked Kizaru if he was able to bypass the Frontier Dome's Defense System with his Devil Fruit Powers, which Kizaru confirmed but told Saturn that Sentomaru was guarding it. To Saturn's suggestion to ignore Sentomaru anyways, Kizaru replied he could not do that since it would go against his own ideals, in addition, Sentomaru would also deploy both the Sea Beast Weapons and Pacifista to attack the fleet", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
