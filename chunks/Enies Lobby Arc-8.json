{"content": "Spandam is shocked, and immediately started to drag Robin away, heading to the Gates of Justice. Before he leaves, he tells CP9 that they have permission to massacre all of the invaders. He ordered Rob Lucci to come with him to take Robin, since he needs to be protected, then called Funkfreed, who turned into a sword. Spandam reflected that with his specially reserved sword and the CP9, he should have nothing to fear.\n\nThe Straw Hats emerged from the wreckage of the Rocketman, having suffered only minor injuries. When they head towards the stairs, they are called by Fukurou, who was in a corner of the room. He tells them that Robin is being taken to the Gates of Justice by Lucci and Spandam, and that CP9 has been given orders to eliminate them. He then showed them a key, which he explained is a key to Robin's Seastone handcuffs. After a bit of conversation amidst the Straw Hats about this, Fukurou explained that Seastone is as hard as diamond, and the handcuffs could never be removed without the key.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Enies Lobby Arc.txt", "title": "Enies Lobby Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 375 to 430"}}
