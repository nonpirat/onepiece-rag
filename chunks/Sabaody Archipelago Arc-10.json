{"content": "This move allows Brook to perform a quick attack on the sleeping riders while running on water, and it also allows Luffy to grab a flying fish only to find it and its rider are asleep which causes him to plummet into Duval's room, wherein Luffy sees his unmasked face - with an extremely shocked reaction. Meanwhile, Brook spots that Zoro's wounds after his battle against Kuma still have not healed, however he tells Brook that he's fine enough to take on the Flying Fish Riders.\n\nHatchan complains to Zoro and Brook that they should still keep their guard up, but Camie and Pappag praise Hatchan. Hatchan turns his back and lowers his guard only to be attacked by another rider but is saved by both Zoro and Brook. As the group of Riders attack the Sunny, they fall to a combination attack of Nami's Clima-Tact and Robin's clutch skills.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
