{"content": "Back at Mermaid Cove, the aforementioned blue-ringed poisonous octopus merman named Hyouzou is seen carrying his unconscious shipmates back to their hideout. Hyouzou hears a scream and comments that the mermaids are noisy. He also remembers that he accidentally poisoned Luffy when the latter struck him. Hyouzou goes on to say that it would be bad if Luffy died, unaware that he had developed an immunity to poison. At the cove, the mermaids realize that the scream came from some of their friends, including a mermaid named Ishilly. A barrel was opened, and their missing friends are nowhere to be found.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
