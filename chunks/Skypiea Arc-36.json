{"content": "- The Going Merry takes significant damage during the Straw Hat Pirates' voyage to and through Skypiea, which ultimately leads to it being declared unfit for sailing and destroyed during the Water 7 Saga.\n\t- The mysterious figure that repaired the Merry is revealed during the Water 7 Arc to be a spirit known as Klabautermann.\n- A Poneglyph is discovered in the ruins of Shandora; Nico Robin deciphers it and discovers the existence of another Ancient Weapon, this one known as Poseidon.\n\t- Robin also finds a message left on the Poneglyph by the Pirate King, Gol D. Roger. This leads her to deduce that the Roger Pirates learned the entire lost history of the world, and that the Rio Poneglyph can be found on the final island Laugh Tale. This is confirmed in the Sabaody Archipelago Arc and the Wano Country Arc.\n- The Straw Hats find and take a large amount of gold from Upper Yard. They exchange this gold for a large sum of money in the Water 7 Arc, and the money plays an important role in the arc's events.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Skypiea Arc.txt", "title": "Skypiea Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 237 to 302"}}
