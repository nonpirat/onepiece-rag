{"content": "Kuma went to Mt. Colubo, where he saw Luffy training and thought back to a previous conversation he had with Dragon. Kuma noticed that Dragon was particularly familiar with Dawn Island and a boy that lived there at a distant village. However, Dragon said he may as well die if he kept talking with Kuma about it because he believes a child is their parent's weak spot. Kuma then understood what Dragon meant and decided to stop discussing it. While training, Luffy was amazed by his new attack and named it Gomu Gomu no Axe, to which he could use against a formidable enemy when he would become a pirate and have a crew to protect. Kuma's Den Den Mushi started ringing as he teleported away before Luffy could spot him.\n\nThe government had given Kuma an order to eliminate a group of pirates that had pillaged a merchant ship. Instead, Kuma chose to check on the merchants and escort those injured to a hospital before returning to have the pirates give back what they stole. He continued writing letters to Bonney.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
