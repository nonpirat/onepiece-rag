{"content": "The Giant Warrior Pirates soon made landfall at Egghead, being instructed by the two captains to take out any enemies they see. Nami and Chopper noticed Oimo and Kashii were also among them, Edison deduced out they came by after hearing the news story, and Usopp realized they had arrived to help them escape. At the Sunny, Brook contacted Nami to let her know the ship would be passing through, but Lilith said to listen to her as there was no plan to stop the ship from hitting the barrier and exploding. As Jinbe went to go break up Zoro and Lucci's fight, Zoro started feeling exhausted and wanted to wrap up the fight, though Lucci taunted him, saying that with him continuing to fight, the crew cannot escape. At sea, the Pacifista have destroyed thirty small and medium ships, with vice admiral Red King giving orders to deploy the battleships against the Pacifista while pulling the smaller ships back.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
