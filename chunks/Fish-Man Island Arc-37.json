{"content": "Meanwhile, Luffy's group marvels at Pappag's house. They enter Criminal, a clothing store, and on the first floor, they find a customer complaining about the prices of the clothes. The customer turns out to be Nami. Nami scolds Pappag for the high prices and demands a discount. As a thank you for their help on Sabaody, Pappag allows the group to have whatever they want for free. After hearing this joyful news, the pirates quickly empty the store, to Pappag's dismay. Unrest suddenly arises outside the shop, and the group rushes out to see why. A figure on a whale comes towards them, revealing himself as the \"Sea God\" Neptune, a coelacanth merman, riding on his whale, Hoe. Camie and Pappag are shocked by his presence. Neptune approaches the group and invites Luffy and the Straw Hats to his palace, much to everyone's surprise.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
