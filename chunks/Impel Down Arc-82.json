{"content": "With this revelation, Luffy angrily asks he if was indeed Blackbeard which the captain realizes he never told Luffy his name before. Blackbeard mentions that he himself was surprised to find out Luffy was the brother of Ace before asking the Straw Hat Captain if he should be hanging around the prison as Ace's execution draws near. Blackbeard explains he found out about Luffy after he defeated Crocodile and due to the newly created open seat as a Warlord, Blackbeard figured it would be a perfect way to make himself known to the World Government. And what better way than to capture Luffy himself, however Ace of course found out and fought to protect Luffy leading to him being captured. Blackbeard, though, considers this fortunate for Luffy since Ace went in his place. As the rest of the Blackbeard Pirates agree on this, a very angered Luffy charges Blackbeard and hits him with a Gomu Gomu no Jet Pistol knocking him into a wall.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Impel Down Arc.txt", "title": "Impel Down Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 525 to 549"}}
