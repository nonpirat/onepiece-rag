{"content": "Luffy had advanced his Kenbunshoku Haki enough to be able to counter Katakuri's attacks and lay hits on the Sweet Commander, and the two of them fought brutally. Luffy then attempted to end their battle by activating a form of Gear 4 known as Snakeman. With Snakeman, Luffy moved at an extremely fast speed, and his attacks changed direction and grew faster. Luffy and Katakuri continued exchanging blows until they eventually headed for a final clash, in which they hit each other with their strongest attacks. Both of them were knocked out for a brief period of time, and when Luffy got up, Katakuri got up as well and foresaw that Luffy would come back and take down Big Mom before falling on his back, defeated. As Luffy headed away, he was then greeted by a disguised Pekoms, who had decided to help him escape to honor Pedro's memory and so had captured Br\u00fbl\u00e9e to get out of the Mirro-World.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Whole Cake Island Arc.txt", "title": "Whole Cake Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 825 to 902"}}
