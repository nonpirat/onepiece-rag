{"content": "Kaidou encased himself in an avatar resembling a larger version of his dragon form, composed of flames hot enough to melt rocks, confident that Luffy would melt to nothing before the attack hit, though Luffy stated that he would never make contact with the technique as his own attack used emissive Haki. With that, Luffy brought down his Gomu Gomu no Bajrang Gun which Kaidou faced head on with Kaen Daiko: Shoryu: Kaen Hakke. As the two clashed, a flashback revealed Kaidou's past: how at 10 he became his homeland's strongest soldier; how at thirteen he started questioning the Celestial Dragons, and how his king attempted to forcibly trade Kaidou to the Marines for the right to attend the Levely; how he frequently escaped and was caught by the Marines, which earned him a starting bounty of 70,000,000; how he became renown of Hachinosu at fifteen and soon recruited by Rocks, with the Rocks Pirates ending up being defeated by Garp and Roger when he was twenty-one; how at thirty-one he was approached by Kurozumi", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
