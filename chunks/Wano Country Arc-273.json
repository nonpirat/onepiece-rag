Drake in turn asked the Magician about his fortune telling, which stated that he would be fine if he didn't betray Kaidou, to which Hawkins replied that since he didn't stand besides Kid and Killer when they confronted the Emperor, and instead gave in, that he had no right to ally himself with them again even he foresaw the outcome of the raid.
