{"content": "Wapol manages to escape arrest and ends up in a dump with a dog named Hakowan that constantly pees on him. Upon which, he sadly realizes that his days as a privileged king were officially over. During the cold season, Wapol tries to make money by selling matches to people, but nobody wanted to get near him. To curb his hunger and sorrow, Wapol begins eating broken toys under a bridge. However, while munching on the junk, he ends up using his Baku Baku Factory technique to combine the toy parts into new, bigger toys. He also ends up eating Hakowan too, turning his head into a box with lens for eyes. The island children see and fall in love with Wapol's new toy creations, so he began selling them for a profit. He eventually makes enough money to build his own toy booth, which booms in popularity. Hakowan also apparently becomes his pet, who constantly follows him.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wapol's Omnivorous Hurrah.txt", "title": "Wapol's Omnivorous Hurrah", "Chapters": "Chapters 236 to 262"}}
