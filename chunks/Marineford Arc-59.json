{"content": "To dispel the doubt beginning to grow within the other captains, Whitebeard shatters the frozen waves with his Devil Fruit powers, giving his subordinate crews a route to escape if they so choose. Whitebeard claims that those who call themselves pirates should choose for themselves what to believe. Witnessing the act of selflessness, the other captains' faith in Whitebeard is instantly renewed. Whitebeard considers to himself that, although people may call him weak, a demon, or a monster, he is only one man with one heart, and as he cannot be the \"strongest\" forever, he should be allowed to raise one young life for the future.\n\nHe then shouts out that those who would follow him should be ready to lose their lives, as he lunges towards the execution platform and into the battlefield. Sengoku calls out for the Marines to be ready, as the \"Strongest Man in the World\" is about to attack. As Whitebeard charges into battle, all of his crew and subordinate crews follow behind and open a path for him.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
