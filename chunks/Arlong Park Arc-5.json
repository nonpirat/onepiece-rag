{"content": "Arlong then heads to Cocoyasi Village, where he confronts Genzo, the village sheriff, for simply collecting a new weapon. It is here that Nojiko reveals to Usopp, both of whom are watching, about the monthly fee the villagers have to pay Arlong in order to survive. Just as Arlong is about to kill Genzo, Usopp saves him. He runs as some of the Fish-Men come after him, while the others drag Arlong off before he goes berserk. Nami arrives sometime later, but the villagers treat her coldly and leave, save for Nojiko and Genzo. The two sisters later visit the grave site of Nami's adoptive mother, Bell-m\u00e8re, where Nami reveals she is almost finished paying Arlong's fee to buy back Cocoyasi.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Arlong Park Arc.txt", "title": "Arlong Park Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 69 to 95"}}
