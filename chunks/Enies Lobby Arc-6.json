{"content": "Franky, impressed by the nerve of the Straw Hats, and knowing he has misjudged Robin, revealed the blueprints that the government had been after. He explained that the architect who wrote the blueprints of Pluton thought there should not exist a weapon like this without having a weapon against it in the case of it falling into the hands of someone like Spandam. Because he figured this was the only way to satisfy the wish of the architect, Franky then burned the blueprints right in front of CP9, telling them that he is betting on the Straw Hats' victory: if they lose, and Robin is taken, the world will end; but if they win, Spandam will be left with nothing. He told Luffy that he will help him with his fight. In anger, Spandam pushed Franky over the balcony, but Kokoro contacts the Straw Hats and told them to jump into the waterfall. Luffy complied, bringing the rest of his crew with him, and they land on the Rocketman as it shoots off the half-open drawbridge. The train caught Franky on its front before", "metadata": {"source": "database/Enies Lobby Arc.txt", "title": "Enies Lobby Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 375 to 430"}}
