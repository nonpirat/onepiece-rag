{"content": "Brook, however, does move forward and in an instant is already behind Zeo. Before Zeo realizes anything, he is cut by Brook's ice sword attack and defeated. Usopp fires his final shot at Daruma who thinks he can just bite the attack. However, Usopp reveals that the bulb from the Pop Green releases a shockwave, knocking him out. Dosun spins, swinging his hammer wildly toward Chopper. But with one massive swipe, Chopper sends him flying much to his troops surprise. Ikaros Much charges at Franky intending to impale him but Franky counters with a laser beam, turning him into roasted squid in an instant (Chopper and Usopp marvel at this as usual while Nami and Robin remain indifferent).", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
