{"content": "Despite all the abuse he's taken, Luffy steadfastly refuses to rat out Ace. Porchemy, tired of getting nowhere, proceeds to kill\u00a0him. Ace and Sabo suddenly burst into the hideout, which the pirates instantly recognized as they were the ones that took their money. Porchemy grabs Ace, but Sabo saves him by knocking Porchemy down. He then grabs a knife, cuts Luffy free, and runs away, yelling at Ace to do so as well. However, Ace decides to stay behind, citing that when he faces an enemy he does not run. Sabo runs back to aid him and the two fight against Porchemy. In the end, the two come out victorious, and Porchemy later faces the wrath of Captain Bluejam, who kills him for his failure. Back in the forest, Sabo scolds Ace for his stubbornness, and Ace scolds Luffy who is crying his eyes out after the encounter. Luffy thanks the two before Ace asks Luffy why he did not talk when he was being tortured. Luffy responds\u00a0that he would not have Ace as a friend anymore and that he did not have anyone on the island", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
