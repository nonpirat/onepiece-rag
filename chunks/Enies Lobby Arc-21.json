{"content": "In Kalifa's room, Nami's battle seemed to have ended prematurely - she lay paralyzed on the floor as Kalifa calmly took a bath. Nami, recovering her strength, tried to attack the CP9 agent, who defended herself with her newfound Devil Fruit powers - she is revealed to have eaten the Awa Awa no Mi, which allows her to create bubbles which can weaken enemies, harden into soap for defense, or transmute an enemy's body entirely (as in the case of Sanji). Having worked this out, Nami continued to fight, but is soon weakened by Kalifa's bubbles.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Enies Lobby Arc.txt", "title": "Enies Lobby Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 375 to 430"}}
