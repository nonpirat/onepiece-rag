{"content": "Meanwhile, the Heart Pirates spot something that kills a Sea King, which then lands on the island near them. The person reveals himself to be Rayleigh, much to their surprise, even more so when he makes it known he knows Luffy is on the island too. Hancock, along with her sisters and Nyon, come to bring Luffy food just as Luffy and Jinbe meet up with Rayleigh. The duo also notices how the Heart Pirates have left, which Rayleigh tells Luffy that Law said to take it easy for two more weeks. Hancock's bunch soon arrive at the group's location, much to Nyon's surprise when she spots Rayleigh, revealing the Boas know him. Luffy and Jinbe begin to eat (though Jinbe was only allowed a little food due to Hancock) while Rayleigh delivers a letter to the Boas from Shakky, which reveals that they know her as well due to the fact that she once lived on the island. Rayleigh also mentions how he figured out Luffy's location thanks to Kuma after the battle on Sabaody, as well as Shakky's intuition after the Marineford War.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
