{"content": "The World Nobles branded a mark on their backs called \"Claw of the Celestial Dragon\" which was meant to signify they were \"less than human\". For four years, they were treated cruelly and faced many hardships and horrors (Sandersonia cries out from the memories of it as Hancock continues the tale). One night, a Fish-Man named Fisher Tiger, who climbed the Red Line with his bare hands, raided Mary Geoise and set fire to it seeking to free all Fish-Men who were sold into slavery.

The Boa sisters quickly escaped, claiming to owe him a debt for their freedom that they can never repay.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Amazon Lily Arc.txt", "title": "Amazon Lily Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 514 to 524"}}
