And the island's residents which include Hatchan, Camie, Pappag, the Mermaid Cafe, and the Princess, say their goodbyes. Luffy calls out to Jinbe who only nods in recognition as a reminder of his promise. As the crew sail off, they are caught up by Shirahoshi who vows that if they meet again, she will not cry anymore and asks if Luffy will take her on another walk, this time outside the ocean. Luffy agrees to this affirming with a pinky promise, the rest of the crew join in too as they take it as their responsibility as well.
