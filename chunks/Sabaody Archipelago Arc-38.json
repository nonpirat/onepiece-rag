{"content": "After much fanfare, Disco introduces Camie to the crowd prompting Nami to get ready to bid for her. However, Charlos blindsides her and everyone in the house with an instant bid of 500,000,000 with no one to outbid him. As Disco begins to close out Camie's auction, Luffy crashes into the auction house as the Fish Rider he was with could not land properly. Zoro is with the two as well having been picked up on the way to the house. The Straw Hats themselves were astounded by the sudden arrival of their two most powerful members, as was everyone else in the auction. Upon seeing Camie, Luffy rushes the stage despite the protest of Hatchan, who is forced to use his remaining arms to try and restrain him. This unfortunately reveals his identity as a Fish-Man to the crowd, and they immediately raise a panic, confirming Robin's earlier story of discrimination against Fish-Men.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
