{"content": "In the Marine Headquarters, Sengoku is informed of Hancock's change of heart and he is relieved as they need all the manpower they can get to go against Whitebeard, since one of the Seven Warlords had already defected and refused to join the fight. He receives news that Whitebeard's 23-ship fleet had suddenly disappeared and that other pirate crews in the New World were taking suspicious actions. Meanwhile, in Impel Down, Garp visits Ace in his cell.

In Mary Geoise, Dracule Mihawk, Gecko Moria, Donquixote Doflamingo, Marshall D. Teach, and Bartholomew Kuma, five of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, have gathered to meet with the Marines to plan for what was to come.\n\nAs Luffy and Hancock go to Impel Down, the fates of the other Straw Hats are shown.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Amazon Lily Arc.txt", "title": "Amazon Lily Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 514 to 524"}}
