{"content": "The Straw Hats and Vivi run to the Going Merry only to find Miss All Sunday, the highest ranking female Baroque Works agent, waiting for them. As it turns out, she was the one who let Vivi find out the boss's identity, yet she was also the one who revealed that she and Igaram were double agents and blew up the ship, so the crew is unsure of what\u00a0side she is on. Ms. All Sunday gives them an Eternal Pose (a permanent Log Pose) to Nanimonai Island, which is supposedly very close to Arabasta, but Luffy destroys it, claiming that she does not decide their course. As Ms. All Sunday leaves, the crew leave for Little Garden, the next island of the Grand Line.\n\nStory Impact", "metadata": {"source": "database/Whisky Peak Arc.txt", "title": "Whisky Peak Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 106 to 114"}}
