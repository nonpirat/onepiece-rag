{"content": "With the only Marines still standing being the Admirals, a few of the Vice Admirals, and those upon the podium, the Whitebeard Pirates prepare to make their final charge to save Ace. Sengoku then tells Garp that the two of them will be required to join the war. Whitebeard orders his men to clear a path for him as he once again makes a swing with his naginata to create another earthquake. Knowing the coming threat, Aokiji tries to attack the Emperor only to have his Ice Ball slice in two by Whitebeard's earthquakes. Whitebeard then impaled Aokiji with his naginata. However, the attack has no effect, as Aokiji made a hole in his chest so that the attack can pass through it. Just as Aokiji is about to try another attack, Jozu knocks him away and tells Whitebeard he will take care of him as Aokiji re-forms himself.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
