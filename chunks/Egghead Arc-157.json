{"content": "Kuma and the elders would raise Bonney together. They noted Bonney had inherited her mother's appetite and soon she had come to accept Kuma as her father, much to his joy. Around this time, he would also join the Revolutionary Army on missions while taking care of her. One day, Kuma ordered for the church windows to be sealed, as Bonney started to develop the same stones on her skin as the ones that killed Ginny. Kuma tried calling the kingdom's doctors over to check what it was, but they had no knowledge of it. Kuma then informed the Revolutionary Army of the situation and resigned so he could look after Bonney, to which Dragon accepted and said they would ask every doctor they could find about the disease. Bonney would be bullied for the stones on her face, but Kuma cheered her up by saying they made her look beautiful. She also told him about how the various places she would like to travel to after her disease was cured.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
