{"content": "Meanwhile, in the Teena Geena Kingdom, on Kenzan Island in the Grand Line, Brook is imprisoned in a cage and is displayed to the public as a freak show. Due to the message that he read in the news, Brook has stayed still for a while, making the audience mad and causing them to think that he is just a prop. After thinking about what he could do to become better, he performs a 40-degree trick and falls down, stating that if he goes lower than his usual 45-degree trick, he will slip and fall. The movement causes the audience to believe he is real and cheer. Brook comes up with a new solo, \"BONE to be Wild\" and starts performing it with a guitar, stating that the word \"ALONE\" is no longer in his dictionary.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
