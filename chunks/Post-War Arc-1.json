{"content": "The world reacts in different ways to Whitebeard's death. Pirates celebrate that Whitebeard's claimed that the One Piece definitely exists. Civilians and Marines cheer that Whitebeard is dead. A band of ferocious pirates, under the helm of the self-proclaimed \"Brownbeard\", attacks the town of Foodvalten, which was formerly protected by Whitebeard. Even though the Marines were triumphant, their victory has inevitably brought nothing but chaos.\n\nHancock, having traced Law's submarine through Salome, turns the Marines on her ship to stone and inquires about Luffy's condition. Law informs Hancock that Luffy's life is preserved for the moment but that he is in critical condition. At that moment, the Impel Down prisoners, led by Ivankov, arrive in a stolen Marine ship.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
