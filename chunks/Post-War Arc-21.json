{"content": "From day to day, they kept getting stronger; fighting pirates, taking baths together, eating together, saving one another during their trips across the mountains; fighting against the wild animals of the forest; getting visited by Garp and beaten senseless; and building their own tree house and living in it; and generally, just acting like boys their age should. Makino and Woop Slap regularly pass by and drop off new clothes for the bunch.\n\nBut one day, Sabo's father found them and, with the assistance of the Bluejam Pirates, captured the three, with Sabo's father claiming Ace and Luffy lured him away from home. Just as the pirates were about to beat Ace and Luffy, Sabo willingly decided to go back with his father to save them, though with great reluctance. Ace and Luffy could do nothing more but beg him to stay as he was led away.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
