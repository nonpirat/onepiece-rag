{"content": "The townsfolk reveal that they also found a poneglyph and give it to Jinbe as thanks for his help, which surprises him. It's also shown that the ruins were placed back underwater near the town's harbor, allowing the Sea Beasts to slumber peacefully again. In addition, the Sea Beasts allow the humans to ride atop their backs as fishing vessels. That night, the townsfolk host a great banquet with Wadatsumi and the sea monsters in attendance.\n\nThe following day, Wadatsumi asks Jinbe if he could go with him on his journey. Jinbe agrees, and with a new kimono for Jinbe and the poneglyph, the two set sail, waving goodbye to the townsfolk and the Sea Beasts.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Solo Journey of Jinbe, Knight of the Sea.txt", "title": "Solo Journey of Jinbe, Knight of the Sea", "Chapters": "Chapters 751 to 785"}}
