Not wanting to fight, Rebecca ran away, but Diamante cut her and prepared to shoot her just like he did to Scarlett. Right then, Kyros came and attacked Diamante, telling Rebecca that she would no longer have to fight. Luffy and Law then came to get the key to Law's handcuffs, and once Law was freed, he used his powers to cut apart the nutcracker chasing them. Luffy and Law headed for the palace, and Diamante tried to stop them, but Law teleported them inside.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
