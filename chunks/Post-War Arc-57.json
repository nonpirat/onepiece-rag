{"content": "In the snow kingdom of Baldimore, Franky finds himself being chased by marines and cyborg animals as he makes his way through Vegapunk's old laboratory. He is unable to defend himself since neither he nor his pursuers wish to damage the place, considering it a \"treasure\". Recalling the conversation, he had with a young boy and his grandfather, they reveal that Vegapunk created a heating system in the form of a mountain to help the island. However, it is incomplete due to the fact that while Vegapunk had the blueprints, he did not have the money or resources to finish it. The old man then warns Franky not to enter the lab, but Franky, having also heard the news of what happened to Luffy, is in need of an ice-breaking ship, and Vegapunk's lab seems to be the only place to find one.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
