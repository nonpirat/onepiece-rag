While talking, it is revealed that Blackbeard murdered the Whitebeard Pirates' 4th Division Commander Thatch, because he acquired the Devil Fruit he had searched for during his time in Whitebeard's service. It is also revealed that Blackbeard joined the Whitebeard Pirates only to find the fruit. He then killed Thatch and ate it. The chapter ends with Blackbeard announcing to Ace that it is a Logia fruit, but it is a very special type and that he is \"Darkness.\"\n\nA vicious battle ensues, and Ace uses a technique in which he makes a perpetual sun. Eventually Ace's hat is seen on the ground and the resolution of the duel is unknown but is stated to be the catalyst for a greater conflict to come.\n\nStory Impact", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-Enies Lobby Arc.txt", "title": "Post-Enies Lobby Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 431 to 441"}}
