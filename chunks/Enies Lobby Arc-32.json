{"content": "The celebration is cut short when the Buster Call arrived, and the top of the Judicial Tower is blown up. The defensive fence surrounding Enies Lobby is also destroyed. Franky shouted out that this is their last chance to escape, as there is an escort ship at the end of the bridge. In the tunnels beneath the towers, Nami, Kokoro (carrying Chopper on her head), Chimney and Gonbe continued their escape.\n\nThe battle with Luffy and Lucci raged on. Luffy is able to land an attack on Lucci, who is forced back with pain. Lucci then explained to Luffy that his Gear 2 ability is wearing his body away and shortening his life span by pumping blood into his legs, causing his blood-flow to speed up. Luffy yelled back that he does not care and wishes to save his comrades first. So Lucci raised the stakes and used a Rankyaku to smash a wall, causing water to flow into the tower and the tunnel system below; anyone in it (namely any of Luffy's comrades trying to catch up to him) will drown.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Enies Lobby Arc.txt", "title": "Enies Lobby Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 375 to 430"}}
