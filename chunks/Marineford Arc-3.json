{"content": "Portgas D. Rouge, the mother of Ace, who was from the South Blue on an isle known as Baterilla, performed a feat that even the Marines did not think was possible. She had kept Ace in her womb for twenty full months, far past the point of Ace's natural childbirth. When Ace was eventually born, Rouge died, having used up all her strength. This took place exactly one year and three months after the death of Ace's true father. Sengoku then announces to the Marines and the world that Ace's father is none other than Gol D. Roger himself. As the Marines react in shock to this, Garp recalls to himself when Roger asked him to take care of Ace, citing that his unborn child bears no sin just for being born.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
