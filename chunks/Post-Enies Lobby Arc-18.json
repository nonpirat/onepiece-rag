{"content": "With the Straw Hats once again whole, the group began to head out just as Garp's ship begins to bear down on them. Before doing so, they realize they must name their ship. Luffy stupidly suggests a few animal combinations with lion (due to the lion-shaped sternhead), but Franky makes a suggestion that Iceburg came up with; since Luffy wants to be the king of pirates then he and the Straw Hats should have a ship that should \"sail thousands of oceans just like the sun\" thus the name \"Thousand Sunny\". The crew instantly take a liking to it (despite Franky also having a name of his own) and thus the Thousand Sunny begins its maiden voyage as Garp prepares to crush the ship with a gigantic iron ball with his bare hands.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-Enies Lobby Arc.txt", "title": "Post-Enies Lobby Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 431 to 441"}}
