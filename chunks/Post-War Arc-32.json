{"content": "Meanwhile, the bandits manage to escape, but a caption comes up revealing that Ace and Dadan did not return as the Gray Terminal continues to burn. The next day, Luffy tries to go out and search for Ace and Dadan, but the bandits tell him that his wounds are still recovering. Plus, the soldiers of Goa are \"cleaning up\" after the fire, including any survivors in the area. At the Gray Terminal, the guards are doing just that, though they remark that there are not as many corpses as they thought there would be, shrugging it off that they burned in the fire. News of Bluejam's boat burning reaches Sabo's ears, whose father comments that it is futile for Sabo to run and that he should just listen to his parents' orders and make them proud. Sabo ignores him and thinks of Luffy and Ace, wondering if they are okay before pondering what the true meaning of freedom is.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Post-War Arc.txt", "title": "Post-War Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 581 to 597"}}
