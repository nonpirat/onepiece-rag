{"content": "Meanwhile, Crocodile and Mr. 1 have been carving through all that gets in their way as Crocodile proceeds towards Whitebeard. While many of Whitebeard's crew attempt to stop Crocodile from attacking the old man again, Crocodile brushes them aside with a sandstorm. Jozu then lunges at Crocodile, using Haki to strike Crocodile with his Brilliant Punk attack. As Jozu attempts to attack Crocodile again, he is stopped by Doflamingo, who is riding on his back and controlling his movement. Although Crocodile seems antagonistic towards Doflamingo, Doflamingo asks if he and Crocodile can team up.\n\nAs Luffy continues to head towards the gallows, yet another enemy crosses his path. Mihawk apologizes to Shanks, as he will not hold himself back. Luffy recognizes Mihawk, who wonders if \"The Next Generation's Golden Child\" is finished or if he will escape Mihawk's black blade.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
