{"content": "In the scrap heap, Kin'emon reunited with Kanjuro, who had hidden inside the wall as a drawing with his Fude Fude no Mi power and drew food to feed himself. Kanjuro drew a bird to fly them out, although the drawing was so pitiful that it could barely fly. The other prisoners in the scrap heap asked Kanjuro to help free them as well, and Kanjuro complied, drawing ladders for them to climb up to the surface. In the town, the citizens found the location of Usopp and Doldo, and went to capture them in hopes of ending Doflamingo's game. Usopp saw the mob heading for them, and after hearing about Maujii's discovery, Viola looked around the palace for Mansherry, who was being held in a small cell somewhere. Kin'emon and Kanjuro then made it to the King's Plateau, and to Usopp's horror, Kanjuro revealed that he had drawn a net for the mob to climb up.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
