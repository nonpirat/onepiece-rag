He states that he would be too humiliated if a weakling like Luffy were to rescue him. However, his true reason for wanting to keep Luffy at bay was so that he would not drag his brother down with him.

As Moria sends his zombies after Luffy, they are drowned and purified in a burst of seawater fired by Jinbe.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
