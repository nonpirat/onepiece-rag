{"content": "Suddenly, it seems like Usopp's attack managed to injure it badly, Franky notes that the Kuma clone is like him; enhanced with weapons but still only human and that one of Usopp's explosive projectiles must have gone inside his mouth and dealt severe internal damage. Kuma tries to blow them all away with a laser from his mouth only for his mouth to be clamped shut by Robin causing to shoot himself, Nami quickly strikes him with a Thunder Lance Tempo. This, however, only causes Kuma to go berserk. Sanji uses Flambage Shot to knock him back, Zoro uses Kiki Kyutoryu: Ashura and Ashura: Makyusen to damage Kuma before Luffy uses Gear 3 and Gomu Gomu no Gigant Rifle to finish him off.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
