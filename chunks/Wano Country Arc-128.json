The rest of the Mink Tribe, due to the All-Star and the strain of Sulong, were left without the strength to continue and collapsed, the same applying to Nangi and the Beasts Pirates' foot soldiers. Kaidou ordered Jack to tend himself as he attempted to burn the Scabbards with his Bolo Breath technique. Kin'emon, however, was able to cut the fire in half as well as a portion of Kaidou's mouth, declaring that neither he nor his fellow Scabbards were going to run away, being ready to die fighting. The Scabbards proceeded to land several hits on Kaidou, including slashing the scar Oden had previously given him. Meanwhile, at Onigashima's front entrance, Big Mom reunited with her eldest son, Perospero, who had joined forces with Marco to infiltrate the island. Once Big Mom reaffirmed her own alliance with Kaidou, Perospero dissolved his alliance with Marco.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Wano Country Arc.txt", "title": "Wano Country Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 909 to 1057"}}
