He then turns to Jinbe and, with his usual grin, asks him to join his crew.\n\nNeptune frees Hody's slaves who are more than happy to leave the island. When asked by his ministers if that is wise, Neptune comments that the island was always a resting spot for pirates, so they have no reason to keep them there. He then turns his attention to the remnants of the New Fish-Man Pirates. They plead they had no idea that Hody was responsible for Otohime's death. Neptune allows them to stay on the island under a sentence of community service for their crimes. He also declares that the Fish-Man District will be blocked off from the island and no one will be allowed to live there. Neptune then asks about the Straw Hats and Fukaboshi tell him they ran away.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Fish-Man Island Arc.txt", "title": "Fish-Man Island Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 603 to 653"}}
