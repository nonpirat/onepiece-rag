{"content": "As Luffy and Chinjao fought, Chinjao began getting emotional as Luffy brought forth memories of his past. They traded blows, but Luffy managed to hit Chinjao with Hawk Rifle. Chinjao claimed that Luffy and the Worst Generation had no chance of conquering the New World, and Luffy propelled himself into the air as Chinjao remembered his past. Thirty years ago, he stashed large amounts of treasure in the Jewel Ice Sheet, which could only be broken by his pointed head. One day he confronted Garp, who smashed his pointed head flat and rendered him unable to access his treasure, leaving him with his grudge against Garp. Chinjao met Luffy in a final clash, and Luffy hit him in the head, causing it to become pointed again. Chinjao was defeated and fell, and his head caused the ring to split in half. Luffy won the C Block battle, and Burgess recognized him.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Dressrosa Arc.txt", "title": "Dressrosa Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 700 to 801"}}
