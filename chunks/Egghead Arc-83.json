Buggy assures him he is under his protection and that his family will be compensated via the bounty reward. As the crew celebrates, one of Buggy's shipwrights announced the completion of the Cross Guild flagship. But to Buggy's dismay, they designed it in his likeness, which did not please Crocodile and Mihawk who dismember and beat up Buggy in private for it. The two then discuss how to go about their operations in becoming a military like power, but Buggy speaks out against them, finding their dreams to be too small-minded.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
