{"content": "After hearing that the ship has been identified as belonging to the Straw Hat Pirates, the mysterious man states his intention to kill \"the man who destroyed my life\". Meanwhile, the Straw Hats approach the base, attempting to figure out ways to defeat the flying fish, although Luffy really just wants to ride one. Camie is worried about Hatchan, although Pappag assures her that he will be safe.\n\nThe Macro Pirates attempt to ask Duval why he made them retreat, and he replies by shooting harpoons at them whilst ranting about the man who ruined his life, striking fear into his own crew as well as the Fish-Men. Macro himself tries to apologize to Duval for the stupidity of his own crew, but Duval congratulates them for revealing the Straw Hats to him. Meanwhile, Hatchan (former Arlong Pirates crew member, now takoyaki salesman), who is tied up in front of Duval is both concerned about Camie and also afraid of hearing the Straw Hats' name mentioned again.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Sabaody Archipelago Arc.txt", "title": "Sabaody Archipelago Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 490 to 513"}}
