As Blackbeard introduces himself, Magellan hits him and his crew with his Hydra coating them with poison. As they reel in pain Magellan continues on coming across a bloodied Hannyabal. The Chief Warden compliments him on holding out as long as he did before ordering him not to die, stating that Hannyabal is the only successor that Magellan would ever accept to replace him.
