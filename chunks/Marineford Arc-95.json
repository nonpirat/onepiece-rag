{"content": "Before Akainu can pursue Luffy to finish him off as well, Whitebeard, enraged at the death of Ace, appears behind him and punches Akainu to the ground, greatly wounding him. Akainu retaliates, burning off a portion of Whitebeard's head with Meigo. Unfazed, Whitebeard slams Akainu aside, injuring him further and, in the process, causing an earthquake that demolishes Marine Headquarters base and splits the plaza in half. This act separates the Marines and the pirates, isolating Whitebeard from his crew. Sengoku is astonished that Whitebeard still has so much power despite his injuries, while Whitebeard states that he is not finished yet.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Marineford Arc.txt", "title": "Marineford Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 550 to 580"}}
