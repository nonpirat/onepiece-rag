{"content": "Bonney soon found out from Conney that Alpha and her group were secretly Cipher Pol agents, and they accidentally revealed that Bonney's disease was already cured while they had drinks. Based on this, Conney deduced that they would not let her go and that they must be why Kuma's letters never arrived. She then urged Bonney to set sail with Gyogyo and the others so she could find Kuma. Bonney used her Devil Fruit power to appear as Conney and sneak out of the church, avoiding Alpha's watch. She made her way to the port where Gyogyo and the others were and they went to sea together. However, they saw themselves being pursued by Alpha, who found out about the plan and threatened to brutalize Bonney and have her crew killed. As Alpha used Geppo to fly towards them, Bonney thought back to a conversation with Kuma, where she learned that Nika had a rubber-like body, thus she used a variant of her Distortion Future technique to gain a physique like Nika and defeat Alpha in one punch, sending her into the ocean.", "metadata": {"source": "database/Egghead Arc.txt", "title": "Egghead Arc", "Chapters": "Chapters 1058 to Current"}}
