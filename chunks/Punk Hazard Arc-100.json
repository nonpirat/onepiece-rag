He rallies his men with a false account of how Vegapunk was malicious in his experiments, and he is trying to show that his gas has the power to be used for good. However, he is deceiving to them, and he reminisces in his mind during his days collaborating with Vegapunk trying to convince him of the gas and giant solider experiments, believing Vegapunk as well as Sengoku are soft for not attempting them. Eventually Vegapunk decided to dismiss him from the science council for such reckless experiments and ordered him to leave the facility.
